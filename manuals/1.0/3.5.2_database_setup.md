# Database configuration


Where is the DB?!

By default, Foreman will use sqlite3 as a database, its configuration can be found at 
<pre>config/database.yml</pre>
By default, the  database can be found at the db subdirectory.
Foreman is a rails application, therefor, anything that is supported under RAILS (sqlite, mysql, postgresql, ...) can be used.
At this time, Oracle DB is known to not work. Patches are welcome!

## I want to use MySQL

edit your config/database.yml and modify:
<pre>
production:
  adapter: mysql
  database: puppet
  username: puppet
  password: password
  host: localhost
  socket: "/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock"
</pre>

If you use foreman 1.0 with  foreman-mysql2 use 'adapter: mysql2' instead

afterwards you would need to re populate your database, simply execute extras/dbmigrate script.

##  I want to switch from SQLite to Mysql and maintain my data
