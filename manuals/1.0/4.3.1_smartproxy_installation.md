# Smart-Proxy Installation

## Description

A smart proxy is an autonomous web-based foreman component that is placed on a host performing a specific function in the host commissioning phase.
It receives requests from Foreman to perform operations that are required during the commissioning process and executes them on its behalf. More details can be found on the [Foreman Architecture](1.1_architecture.html) page.

To fully manage the commissioning process then a smart proxy will have to manipulate these services, DHCP, DNS, Puppet CA, Puppet and TFTP. These services may exist on separate machines or several of them may be hosted on the same machine. As each smart proxy instance is capable of managing all the of these services, there is only need for one proxy per host.
In the special case of a smart proxy managing a windows DHCP server, the host machine must be running Windows and support the **netsh dhcp** utility, it does not need to be the Microsoft DHCP server itself.

To install Smart-Proxy, run

<pre>
  # Debian Linux (as root)
  apt-get update
  apt-get install foreman-proxy

  # Ubuntu Linux (as normal user)
  sudo aptitude update
  sudo aptitude install foreman-proxy
</pre>

### Debian Linux 5.0 (Lenny)

Users of Debian Lenny will have to use [rake](http://packages.debian.org/lenny-backports/rake), [rack](http://packages.debian.org/lenny-backports/librack-ruby), and [Sinatra](http://packages.debian.org/lenny-backports/libsinatra-ruby) from *lenny-backports*.

See [http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/](http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/) for instructions on how to add **lenny-backports** to your list of repositories and install a package from it.

Please note that you'll have to install the packages from *lenny-backports* using *apt-get -t lenny-backports install libsinatra-ruby*.


## Configuration file

Usually can be found at /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml or on the config/settings.yml subdirectory.
You can use the *settings.yml.example* file inside the *config* directory as a template for your own *settings.yml*.

If you don't plan to use one of the subsystems, please disable them in this configuration file. For more information see [Smartproxy Configuration](/manuals/1.0/4.3.2_smartproxy_settings.html)


## Start the daemon

<pre>
  bin/smart-proxy.rb
</pre>

Or if you installed it via a package simply start the foreman-proxy service.

## Add the smart-proxy to Foreman

* Go to [FOREMAN_URL]/smart_proxies and click *New Proxy*
* Type in the Name for your Proxy and the URL of your Proxy, with the Port used.

For example: 
<pre>
  Name: Puppet-Proxy
  URL: http://puppet.your-domain.com:8443 
</pre>
