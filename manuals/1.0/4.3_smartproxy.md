# Smart-Proxy Installation

## Description

A smart proxy is an autonomous web-based foreman component that is placed on a host performing a specific function in the host commissioning phase. 
It receives requests from Foreman to perform operations that are required during the commissioning process and executes them on its behalf. More details can be found on the [[Foreman Architecture]] page.

To fully manage the commissioning process then a smart proxy will have to manipulate these services, DHCP, DNS, Puppet CA, Puppet and TFTP. These services may exist on separate machines or several of them may be hosted on the same machine. As each smart proxy instance is capable of managing all the of these services, there is only need for one proxy per host.
In the special case of a smart proxy managing a windows DHCP server, the host machine must be running Windows and support the *netsh dhcp* utility, it does not need to be the Microsoft DHCP server itself.
