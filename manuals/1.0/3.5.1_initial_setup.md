# Initial setup

## Configuration

Foreman configuration is managed from two places; a configuration file *config/settings.yaml* and from the *SETTINGS/Foreman Settings* page. A full description of the configuration options is given at [foreman_configuration](#)

## Database

Foreman uses a database, this database can be shared with Puppet store-configs (they are compatible, as Foreman extends the puppet database schema). By default, SQLite is used, if you want to use other database (e.g. [FAQ#I-want-to-use-MySQL|MySQL](#)) please modify the configuration file under *config/database.yml*.

If you want to share the database with Puppets (storeconfig), just modify *config/database.yml* to point to the same database configuration as puppet is.

In both cases, please use the *production* settings.

to initialize the database schema type:
<pre>cd <foreman installation path> && RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate</pre>

On foreman 1.0 use bundle:
<pre>cd <foreman installation path> && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate</pre>

For more information please see the database configuration page [here](3.5.2_database_setup.html)

## Import Data from Puppet

At this point, you might want to go through the [[FAQ]] to see how can you import your data into Foreman.

## Start The Web Server

if you installed via rpm, just start the foreman service, or start the builtin web server by typing: 
<pre>RAILS_ENV=production rails server</pre>

and point your browser to `http://foreman:3000`

If you would like to keep the server running, its recommend to setup
passenger or use the RPM. Example usage with passenger can be found on
[GitHub](http://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman/blob/master/templates/foreman-vhost.conf.erb).

## Getting your Puppet Reports into Foreman

Read [Puppet_Reports](3.5.3_puppet_reports.html) to learn how to get your nodes to report to Foreman.
