Smart variables are a tool to provide global parameters (key/value data), normally to your Puppet ENC, depending on a set of rules. They are intended to be a stepping stone to full parameterized classes, when the class hasn't been parameterized or in special cases when a global parameter is desired.  The [same matching/rules technology](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.2.6SmartMatchers) underpins both smart variables and smart class parameters.  If in doubt, use [smart class parameters](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.2.5ParameterizedClasses).

Smart variables are associated with a Puppet class, but they result in a global parameter.  They may have multiple possible values, all depending on hierarchical context or various conditions a user can wish to apply.  For example:

#### Creating a smart variable

Start by going to *Configure > Classes* and then click one of your classes to edit it.

Click on the *Smart Variables* tab. If you have any existing smart variables, they will be listed at the left side of the tab.

Click New Variable, and you will be presented with a set of input fields:

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Parameter</td>
      <td>What the parameter will be called in the ENC data</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Parameter type</td>
        <td>This dropdown allows validating that all values are of the correct type</td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>A free form text box for your own information</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Default Value</td>
      <td>Value supplied to the ENC if no other criteria is matched</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hidden value</td>
      <td>Should the values of the smart variable be hidden in the UI</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

Once you've created the defaults for your smart variable, you can then add at least one criterion to match against - click the "Add Matcher" button at the bottom of the form and a new row will be added to the matchers table:

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Attribute type</td>
      <td>Should state a name = value relationship that Foreman use to match against the entries in searchlist</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value</td>
      <td>What the parameter should be in the ENC, if this rule is matched</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

#### Advanced usage

Smart variables are based on the smart matchers technology, and have a number of advanced features such as validation and multiple data types.  More about these can be found in the [Smart Matchers](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.2.6SmartMatchers) section.

#### API usage

It's also possible to retrieve these values if you're not using a ENC, via a custom Puppet function or a http request.. You'll need to retrieve the value from

    https://foreman/api/v2/hosts/<fqdn>/smart_variables/<parameter>

You can find a ready-made function for your puppet module [here](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman/blob/master/lib/puppet/parser/functions/smartvar.rb)
