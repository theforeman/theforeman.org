## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### Host Registration
New simplified process of registering hosts to the Foreman. With utilization of provisioning templates,
already running hosts can be registered to the Foreman with one command.
For more details about registration process:
* New page _All Hosts > Register Host_
* Provisioning templates _Global Registration_ & _Linux registration default_
* [RFC - Simple & automatic host registration WF](https://community.theforeman.org/t/rfc-simple-automatic-host-registration-wf/19588)

#### Safe mode template preview when safe mode rendering is disabled
When template safe mode rendering is disabled in the settings, users can now preview rendering of templates with safe mode enabled. This will enable updating templates to ensure they render properly under safe mode before turning it on for the whole Foreman. ([#30949](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/30949))

#### Show instance name in top menu
For users managing multiple Foreman instances, a new setting (`instance_title`) has been introduced that allows setting a name for each instance. When set, an icon will appear on the top bar which will display the instance name when hovered over. ([#29024](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/29024))

### Deprecations

* Support for oVirt API version 3 is deprecated and will be removed in the next Foreman version. The version 3 API has been long deprecated by the oVirt project and is no longer supported in current releases.

### Upgrade warnings

* Index and column named `digest` on SQL tables `messages` and `sources` will be dropped during `db:migrate` step and replaced by more effective hash index on column named `value`. While we are working on redesigning how reports are stored in the SQL database, hash indices are faster and use significantly less memory storage than btree in this case. Our tests indicate that on a standard VM, index creation rate is at 18 million records per minute, this step should be from seconds to several minutes depending on size of the tables.
* Report creation via `/api/v2/config_reports/` REST POST no longer returns the full report for performance reasons. Only basic metadata like database ID is returned, when full report is needed query the same REST resource via HTTP GET method to fetch it. More info at https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/pull/7987
* The following fact names are ignored by default due to high frequency of changes:
`load_averages`, `memory::system` and `memory::swap` (`capacity`, `used`, `available names`).
Ignored facts can be changes in Administer - Settings - Provisioning.
* The default logging layout has been changed from `multiline_pattern` to `multiline_request_pattern`. The new layout includes the request identifier in error stack traces as well, allowing for easier debugging of a specific request.
