As described in [5.2.10](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#5.2.10PasswordEncryption), passwords stored locally in Foreman's DB are encrypted. In order for multiple Foreman instances to encrypt and decrypt passwords correctly, they all need to have the same encryption key defined in `/etc/foreman/encryption_key.rb`.
