In this chapter, we will describe how to setup a Smart Proxy to serve
provisioning templates.

The smart proxy is able to proxy template requests from hosts in isolated
networks to the Foreman server, when the proxy also handles TFTP.

<div class="alert alert-info">Generally, you want the templates to be available on HTTP as well as HTTPS.  When enabling HTTP on your smart proxy, ensure that other modules' configurations in /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/*.yml are secure by setting :enabled: to https instead of true.</div>

Ensure the foreman_url in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yaml` points to your Foreman instance, and that your smart proxy is listening on HTTP by uncommenting `http_port`. Now
configure `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/templates.yml`:

    :enabled: true
    :template_url: http://smart-proxy.example.com:8000

Once you've completed the above steps, restart the foreman-proxy service and refresh the features on your Foreman server.

The templates feature is used automatically: any host that uses this proxy for TFTP will also use the proxy to retrieve its templates.
