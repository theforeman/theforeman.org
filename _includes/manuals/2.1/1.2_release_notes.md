## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### Templates DSL documentation

Foreman now has documentation for DSL used for templates writing. This should
make template writing process easier for non-Rubyists as well as for people who
aren't familiar with all the methods Foreman provides. Documentation is available
locally under `https://<fqdn>/templates_doc`. This documentation will be gradually
enhanced in future releases to cover all available methods and macros.

#### External IPAM

New Smart Proxy External IPAM API allows implementation of IPAM providers.
Subnets can be now associated with IPAM plugins providing IP address management
capabilities via external entities. An experimental implementaion for phpIPAM
is available as a [Smart Proxy plugin](https://github.com/grizzthedj/smart_proxy_ipam).

### Release Notes

### Deprecations

* Trends and statistics are being moved to separate plugin next release. See [manual](/plugins/foreman_statistics) of the new Statistics plugin.

### Upgrade warnings

* Due to changes in the build process, the API docs shipped with foreman and its plugins will no longer contain information about the data types of search fields. These will still be available in the API documentation on the website, and can be generated locally if needed by running `foreman-rake apipie:cache` on your Foreman server.
* Rackspace compute resource which has been deprecated in 2.0 has now been dropped. Any existing Rackspace compute resources will be deleted as part of the upgrade.
* The RPM packages are not tested on Scientific Linux or Oracle Linux. The Foreman installation on Scientific Linux or Oracle Linux may or may not work.
