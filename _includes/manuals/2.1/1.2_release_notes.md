## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### Templates DSL documentation

Foreman now has documentation for DSL used for templates writing. This should
make template writing process easier for non-Rubyists as well as for people who
aren't familiar with all the methods Foreman provides. Documentation is available
locally under `https://<fqdn>/templates_doc`. This documentation will be gradually
enhanced in future releases to cover all available methods and macros.

#### External IPAM

New Smart Proxy External IPAM API allows implementation of IPAM providers.
Subnets can be now associated with IPAM plugins providing IP address management
capabilities via external entities. An experimental implementaion for phpIPAM
is available as a [Smart Proxy plugin](https://github.com/grizzthedj/smart_proxy_ipam).

#### Rails 6 upgrade

Foreman has been updated to run on the latest version of Ruby on Rails at the time of the release, 6.0.2. Many plugins have already been updated as well, but there may be issues with any that have not seen a new release in a while.

#### Support installation on EL8 distributions

Foreman installation is now possible on EL8 distributions. The installer has been updated to support changes needed for these and yum repositories now contain packages for EL8. Note that installation is only supported and tested on RHEL and CentOS, packages may or may not work on Oracle Linux or Scientific Linux.

#### Switch default web server from Passenger to Puma

The default installation of Foreman will now set up Puma behind Apache reverse proxy instead of Passenger with mod_passenger. This will enable us to use Web Sockets in the future as well as additional benefits with regards to certificate handling and unifying development and production setups.

### Deprecations

* Trends and statistics are being moved to separate plugin next release. See [manual](/plugins/foreman_statistics) of the new Statistics plugin.
* Helper named `foreman_url` now requires argument which represents template kind to render. Previously, no argument was allowed to render `provision` template kind. All default templates were updated, for custom templates rewrite `foreman_url` to `foreman_url('provision')`.

### Upgrade warnings

* Due to changes in the build process, the API docs shipped with foreman and its plugins will no longer contain information about the data types of search fields. These will still be available in the API documentation on the website, and can be generated locally if needed by running `foreman-rake apipie:cache` on your Foreman server.
* Rackspace compute resource which has been deprecated in 2.0 has now been dropped. Any existing Rackspace compute resources will be deleted as part of the upgrade. [More info](https://community.theforeman.org/t/dropping-rackspace-compute-resource-from-foreman-core/17690)
* The RPM packages are not tested on Scientific Linux or Oracle Linux. The Foreman installation on Scientific Linux or Oracle Linux may or may not work.
* TLSv1.1 is no longer supported for the Smart Proxy. Clients connecting to the proxy should use TLSv1.2 or newer.
* PuppetDB module is no longer part of the Foreman installer. Users who use PuppetDB should manage it on their own and not rely on the Foreman installer to do so. [More info](https://community.theforeman.org/t/drop-puppetlabs-puppetdb-from-foreman-installer/17787)
