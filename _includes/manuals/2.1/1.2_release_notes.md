## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features

#### External IPAM

New Smart Proxy External IPAM API allows implementation of IPAM providers.
Subnets can be now associated with IPAM plugins providing IP address management
capabilities via external entities. An experimental implementation for phpIPAM
is available as a [Smart Proxy plugin](https://github.com/grizzthedj/smart_proxy_ipam).

#### Rails 6 upgrade

Foreman has been updated to run on the latest version of Ruby on Rails at the time of the release, 6.0.2. Many plugins have already been updated as well, but there may be issues with any that have not seen a new release in a while.

#### Support installation on EL8 distributions

Foreman installation is now possible on EL8 distributions. The installer has been updated to support changes needed for these and yum repositories now contain packages for EL8. Note that installation is only supported and tested on RHEL and CentOS, packages may or may not work on Oracle Linux.

Please note that Katello 3.16 cannot be deployed on EL8 systems. Katello 4.0, however, will be deployable on EL8 systems.

#### Switch default web server from Passenger to Puma

The default installation of Foreman will now set up Puma behind Apache reverse proxy instead of Passenger with mod_passenger. This will enable us to use Web Sockets in the future as well as unifying development and production setups.

By default it is deployed using [systemd socket activation](http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation.html). The service `foreman.socket` binds to `127.0.0.1:3000` and passes this to `foreman.service`. That means `foreman.service` can be stopped, started and restarted independently of the socket resulting in no dropped requests from Apache.

### Known Issues
* The version of `rubygem-net-ssh` package required by Foreman is incompatible with the version provided EPEL8. Users who wish to install Foreman on EL8 should ensure that EPEL repository is disabled or that the conflicting package is excluded.
* During upgrade testing, there have been a few cases where a 502 error was encountered when the installer tried to register the integrated Smart Proxy to Foreman. While we believe we have likely resolved the root cause, if this error is encountered, try re-running the installer again.
* External authentication does not work properly with the Puma server. This will be [fixed](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/30535) in Foreman 2.2. In the meantime, users requiring external authentication should continue using the Passenger server. This can be done by running the installer with the `--foreman-passenger` flag, and ensuring that `/etc/httpd/conf.d/passenger.conf` is properly configured (you may need to run `yum reinstall mod_passenger` for that).

### Deprecations

* Ability to trigger puppet run for hosts from Foreman is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.2 ([more info](https://community.theforeman.org/t/dropping-run-puppet-button-with-a-replacement-using-remote-execution-plugin/12781/25)). The same functionality can be achieved using the Remote Execution plugin. There are two options:
    * There is a `Puppet run once - SSH default` job template that takes `puppet_options` as parameter before it's invoked. There are also similar templates for other Remote Execution providers.
    * Another option is for `mcollective`/`choria` users. The best way is to write your own job template that leverages `load_hosts` macro for choosing hosts and use it as a parameter for `mco` program, for example: `mco rpc puppetd runonce -I <%= load_hosts(search: input('hosts')).join(' ') %>`. This template would be executed against a host that has `mco` and access to the target hosts, instead of being executed at the target hosts directly.
* Trends and statistics are being moved to separate plugin next release. See the [manual](/plugins/foreman_statistics) of the new Statistics plugin for more information.
* Template helper named `foreman_url` now requires argument which represents template kind to render. Previously, no argument was allowed to render `provision` template kind. All default templates were updated, for custom templates rewrite `foreman_url` to `foreman_url('provision')`.

### Upgrade warnings

* Due to changes in the build process, the API docs shipped with foreman and its plugins will no longer contain information about the data types of search fields. These will still be available in the API documentation on the website, and can be generated locally if needed by running `foreman-rake apipie:cache` on your Foreman server.
* Rackspace compute resource which has been deprecated in 2.0 has now been dropped. Any existing Rackspace compute resources will be deleted as part of the upgrade. [More info](https://community.theforeman.org/t/dropping-rackspace-compute-resource-from-foreman-core/17690)
* The RPM packages are not tested on Scientific Linux or Oracle Linux. The Foreman installation on Scientific Linux or Oracle Linux may or may not work.
* TLSv1.1 is no longer supported for the Smart Proxy. Clients connecting to the proxy should use TLSv1.2 or newer.
* PuppetDB module is no longer part of the Foreman installer. Users who use PuppetDB should manage it on their own and not rely on the Foreman installer to do so. [More info](https://community.theforeman.org/t/drop-puppetlabs-puppetdb-from-foreman-installer/17787)
* Debian/Ubuntu ARM packages are not built anymore, as we have no reliable build infrastructure for ARM anymore. [More info](https://community.theforeman.org/t/dropping-debian-arm-packages/18840)
