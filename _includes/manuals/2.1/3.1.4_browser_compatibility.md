Using the most recent version of a major browser is highly recommended, as Foreman and the frameworks it uses offer limited support for older versions.

The recommended requirements are as follows for major browsers:

* Google Chrome 54 or higher
* Microsoft Edge
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 or higher
* Mozilla Firefox 49 or higher

Other browsers may work unpredictably.
