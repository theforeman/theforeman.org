### Single Sign-on for Foreman using OpenID Connect protocol

An OpenID Provider(OP) implements a Single Sign-on (SSO) using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. OIDC verifies the identity of the End-user depending on the given authentication details. In this example, [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) is used as the OpenID provider, and Foreman is the Relying Party (RP).

OpenID provider provides an ID Token, encoded in JSON Web Token (JWT) to Foreman.

An example of an encoded JWT ID Token:

```

```

#### Configuring Foreman

As a system administrator, execute the following procedure to configure Foreman.

Prerequisites

* A working installation of Foreman at https://foreman.example.com.
* A working installation of OpenID provider, for example, Keycloak at https://keycloak.example.com, which uses the OIDC protocol. Ensure that the Keycloak server is running.
* Ensure that both RP and OpenID provider are using https instead of http. If the certificates or the CA is self-signed, ensure that they are added to the End-user certificate trust store.

Procedure

1. Install the mod_auth packages:
```console
# yum install mod_auth_openidc keycloak-httpd-client-install -y
```
Note: OIDC support is added to the keycloak-httpd-client-install package with minimum requirement of version 1.x.

2. Register Katello/Foreman as application in the Keycloak:
```console
# export KEYCLOAK_URL=https://keycloak.example.com
# export KEYCLOAK_REALM=ssl-realm
# export KEYCLOAK_USER=admin
# keycloak-httpd-client-install --app-name foreman-openidc --keycloak-server-url $KEYCLOAK_URL --keycloak-admin-username $KEYCLOAK_USER --keycloak-realm $KEYCLOAK_REALM --keycloak-admin-realm master --keycloak-auth-role root-admin -t openidc -l /users/extlogin -d
```
Warning: This feature is not yet supported by foreman-installer. As a result, re-running the foreman-installer command can purge the changes in Apache files added by the keycloak-httpd-client-install.

3. Log in to the Foreman admin page and click **Administer** → **Settings** → **Authentication**.

4. Set **authorize_login_delegation_auth_source_user_autocreate** to **External** to enable auto-creation of users from external OpenID provider.

5. Set the following OIDC parameters:

 **OIDC Algorithm**: Algorithm type with which JWT was encoded in the OpenID provider. For example, set this parameter to RS256.

 **OIDC Audience**: Name of the OIDC audience used for authentication. In case of Keycloak, it is Client ID.

 **OIDC Issuer**: The Issuer (iss) claim identifies the principal that issues the JWT.

 **OIDC JWKS URL**: Open JSON Web key Set URL to validate the signature.

#### End-user

An end user can perform SSO by the following ways:
* User Interface
* Hammer-CLI

To perform the mentioned ways, ensure that Foreman is configured.

##### User Interface

Procedure

* Log in to the https://foreman.example.com/users/extlogin

 Foreman will automatically redirect to Keycloak Sign-in page. If credentials are correct, it redirects to the Foreman dashboard.

##### Hammer-cli

Hammer-cli supports the following methods to obtain ID token and perform authentication:

* Authorization Code Grant Flow
* Password Grant Flow

###### Authorization Code Grant Flow

Authorization Code Flow is a two step process:

* Authorization Code Flow returns an Authorization Code to the client.
* This Code can be exchanged for an access token directly.

Procedure

1. Get the token endpoint and authorization endpoint from the .well-known/openid-configuration URL of your OpenID provider. For example in case of Keycloak, get token and authorization endpoint from: https://<keycloak.example.com>/auth/realms/<realm-name>/.well-known/openid-configuration

2. Log in to Foreman:
```console
hammer auth login oauth --two-factor --oidc-token-endpoint https://keycloak.example.com/token --oidc-authorization-endpoint https://keycloak.example.com/auth --oidc-client-id foreman-client --oidc-redirect-uri urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob
```

###### Password Grant Flow

The end user provides username and password for authentication and makes a POST request to the OpenID provider to exchange the password for an access token.

Procedure

1. Get token endpoint from the .well-known/openid-configuration URL of your OpenID provider. For example in case of Keycloak get token endpoint from: https://<keycloak.example.com>/auth/realms/<realm-name>/.well-known/openid-configuration

2. Log in to Foreman:
```console
hammer auth login oauth --oidc-token-endpoint https://keycloak.example.com/token --oidc-client-id foreman-client --username myuser --password changeme
```
