#### Users

Email messages are sent to individual users registered to Foreman, to the email address configured on the account if present.  Users can edit the email address by clicking on their name in the top-right hand corner of the web page and selecting *My account*.

To change which message subscriptions are received by an individual user, the *Mail Preferences* tab under the user account lists all available message types and the frequency at which each message should be received.  A global checkbox to disable all email messages from Foreman is also available.

Event-based notifications can either be enabled or disabled, and these are sent from Foreman at the same time as the event occurring.  Scheduled notifications can be sent either daily, weekly or monthly.

#### Hosts

Notifications relating to hosts can be disabled on a per-host basis, useful when errors are expected.  On the host's *Additional Information* tab, untick *Enabled* to disable notifications and remove the host from reports.  Enabling and disabling notifications can also be done from the host list by using the tickboxes and selecting *Enable/Disable Notifications* from the *Select Action* dropdown menu.

Event notifications for a host are sent to the host's registered owner.  This is selected on the *Additional Information* tab of the host, and may be either an individual user or a user group.  When set to a user group, all group members who are subscribed to the email type will receive a message.
