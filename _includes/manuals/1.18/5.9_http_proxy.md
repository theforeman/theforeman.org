If Foreman is running behind a Firewall, that has HTTP and HTTPS blocked a HTTP proxy can be configured to allow requests with external systems, including Smart Proxies.

The following settings allow configuring what HTTP proxy to use and a list of hosts to which requests do not need to pass over the HTTP proxy.

 * `:http_proxy:` - The hostname, port (and Authentication if required) as `http://[user:password@]HOST:PORT`
 * `:http_proxy_except_list:` - An array of hostnames

 Both settings can also be accessed by administrators in the web interface under _Adminsiter -> Settings_
