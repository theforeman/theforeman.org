You can search hosts by global status. Some examples can be found below:

* search for all hosts that are OK

     `global_status = ok`

* search for all hosts that deserves some attention

    `global_status = error or global_status = warning`

To search hosts based on configuration status you can search by last report
metrics like this:

* find hosts that have at least one pending resource

    `status.pending > 0`

* find hosts that restarted some service during last puppet run

    `status.restarted > 0`

* find hosts that have an interesting last Puppet run (something happened)

    `status.interesting = true`
