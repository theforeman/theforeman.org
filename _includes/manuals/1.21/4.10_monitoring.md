To monitor your infrastructure, host statuses are useful. In Foreman each host
has a *global* status that indicates which hosts need attention. Each host also
has sub-statuses that represents status of a particular feature. With any change
of a sub-status, the global status is recalculated and the result is determined
by statuses of all sub-statuses.
