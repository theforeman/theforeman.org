## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features

#### Ansible inventory template

We've already eliminated the necessity for Katello to use Ansible Inventory ([#31193](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/31193)). This change eliminates the need for the Ansible plugin to render Ansible inventory. ([#31482](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/31482))

#### Enhanced security out of the box

The installer configures services to [only allow TLS 1.2+ connections](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/31386). Where [Foreman Proxy 2.1 already took this step](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/29252), Apache still allowed TLS 1.0 and 1.1 connections by default. In current environments, everything should support TLS 1.2.

Additionally, it is stricter in reverse proxy handling. Out of the box Rails accepts any reverse proxy on [local IPs](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/8da6ba9cae21beae1ee3c379db7b7113d2731c9b/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/remote_ip.rb#L31-L42).  This is reduced to [localhost only](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/30779) and consistently used throughout the application. This can impact users of reverse proxies.

See the upgrade warnings for more information.

####  Personal Access Tokens

Personal Access Tokens were introduced in Foreman 1.17 version with API endpoints only. Now, you can manage Personal Access Tokens through the Foreman web UI. You can generate a new token and set it to expire at a certain date and time. To make tokens void before their expiration date and time, you can use the revoke action. ([#31080](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/31080))

* New tab: Hover to current logged in user -> _My Account_ -> _Personal Access Tokens_

#### Support for Redfish to BMC Smart Proxy

Redish is now available as another BMC provider. Some of the features, such as boot media, weren't available across all vendors (HPE and Dell in particular). The Redfish provider for the BMC Smart Proxy solves this issue while also potentially allowing additional BMC functions to be integrated. ([#29636](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/29636))

### Deprecations

#### Passenger support

Foreman 2.1 started to default to Puma while still allowing to fall back to Passenger. This support was kept in for users who ran into problems. Now that it has been the default for a few releases, this release deprecates Passenger support which [will be removed in the future](https://community.theforeman.org/t/drop-passenger-support/22787). Users are strongly encouraged to switch to Puma or reach out if there's something holding them back.

#### Puppet ENC

Puppet specific ENC functionality is deprecated and [will be moved to a plugin in the future](https://community.theforeman.org/t/puppet-plugin-release-and-its-future/22335).

Features to be removed include:
* Environment
* Puppetclass
* ConfigGroup
* SmartClassParameter

Endpoint `/enc` will continue to provide information about the Host, but without the removed information.
Users who want to continue using these features are advised to [follow the Puppet plugin stabilization](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/32182) and install it alongside the next Foreman version or report any issues holding them from doing so.

### Upgrade warnings

#### TLS 1.2+ by default

The installer will configure all services to drop TLS 1.0 and 1.1 support. Back in Foreman 2.1 all internal services (Smart Proxy and friends) dropped TLS 1.0 and 1.1. Now the remaining parts are updated, which effectively is only Apache. This means clients need to support TLS 1.2.

Users who have client systems that don't support TLS 1.2 should update those. RHEL 6.8 added support via [RHBA-2016:0915](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2016:0915) back in 2016. Note that CentOS 6 is already End of Life. If you are on a supported release, it's very unlikely that this affects you. Also note that some older enterprise HTTP proxies or firewalls are known to cause problems.

EL5 does [not support TLS 1.2](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1294573) but is End Of Life.

#### Reverse proxy handling

Rails by default includes middleware that accepts a [wide range of reverse proxies](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/8da6ba9cae21beae1ee3c379db7b7113d2731c9b/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/remote_ip.rb#L31-L42:

* 127.0.0.0/8 localhost IPv4 range, per [RFC-3330](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3330)
* ::1 localhost IPv6, per [RFC-4291](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.3)
* fc00::/7 private IPv6 range fc00::/7, per [RFC-4193](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4193)
* 10.0.0.0/8  private IPv4 range 10.x.x.x, per [RFC-1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)
* 172.16.0.0/12  private IPv4 range 172.16.0.0 .. 172.31.255.255, per [RFC-1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)
* 192.168.0.0/16  private IPv4 range 192.168.x.x, per [RFC-1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)

The end result is that when a reverse proxy setup is used, as Foreman starting 2.1 does by default, that those IP addresses no longer show up in logs. This includes auditing and Foreman's production log since they're considered proxies. That means the connecting IP is considered the client address. The IP connecting to the application server is Apache from 127.0.0.1.

To resolve this, Foreman 2.4 configures Rails to only consider 127.0.0.1 and ::1 proxies. However, if there are reverse proxies on a different IP, they will then show up as the client IP instead. To work around that, a `:trusted_proxies` setting in `settings.yaml` is introduced. This can't be in the database since Rails' middleware doesn't support this. Because of this, an application restart is required if a reverse proxy is added. Today there is no installer support for this.

Users of Katello should note that content proxies deploy a reverse proxy by default.
