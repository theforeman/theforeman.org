#### Downloading the installer

Follow the instructions in section [2.1 Quickstart installation](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#2.1Installation)

#### Running the installer

The installation run is non-interactive, but the configuration can be customized by supplying any of the options listed in `foreman-installer --help`, or by running `foreman-installer -i` for interactive mode.  More examples are given in the [Installation Options](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.2.2InstallerOptions) section.  Adding `-v` will disable the progress bar and display all changes, while `--noop` will run without making any changes.  To run the installer, execute:

{% highlight bash %}
foreman-installer
{% endhighlight %}

After it completes, the installer will print some details about where to find Foreman and the Smart Proxy. Output should be similar to this:

{% highlight bash %}
  * Foreman is running at https://theforeman.example.com
      Initial credentials are admin / 3ekw5xtyXCoXxS29
  * Foreman Proxy is running at https://theforeman.example.com:8443
  * The full log is at /var/log/foreman-installer/foreman-installer.log
{% endhighlight %}
