The global status represents the overall status of a particular host. The
status can have one of three possible values - **OK**, **Warning** or
**Error**.

OK means that no errors were reported by any sub-status. It is represented
with the color green.

Warning suggests that user should verify the status, while
no error was detected, some sub-status raised a warning. A good example would
be that there are no Puppet reports for the host even though the host is
configured to send Puppet reports. Therefore it is highlighted with the color
yellow.

The last possible value is Error which indicates that some sub-status
reports a failure. This could for example mean that Puppet run contains
some failed resources. Obviously it is something that should be fixed and
is user is alerted by the color red.

You can find global status on hosts overview page displayed as a small icon
next to host name with corresponding color. Hovering over the icon renders
a tooltip with sub-status information to quickly find out more details.
