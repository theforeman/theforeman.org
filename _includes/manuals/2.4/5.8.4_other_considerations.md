There are other considerations when creating a cluster:

1. You might want to share a common hostname, which can be set during installation or by modifying your Apache config files.
2. You might want a custom cert to reflect the cluster's cname, and you'll want to make sure your Foreman-related infrastructure is [configured to use SSL](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#5.4SecuringCommunicationswithSSL).
3. You can use a central memcached instance instead of each Foreman instance's local cache. Foreman has a [plugin](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_memcache) you can use.
