Single object JSON responses are used to show a single object. The object's unique identifier `:id` or `:name` is required in the **GET** request. Note that `:name` may not always be used as a unique identifier, but `:id` can always be used. The format for a single object JSON response consists of only the object's attributes. There is **no root node** and **no metadata** by default. See [Section 5.1.4](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#5.1.4CustomizeJSONResponses) for how to add a root name.

Below is an example of the format for a single object JSON response: `GET /api/domains/23` or `GET /api/domains/qa.lab.example.com`

    {
        "id": 23,
        "name": "qa.lab.example.com",
        "fullname": "QA",
        "dns_id": 10,
        "created_at": "2013-08-13T09:02:31Z",
        "updated_at": "2013-08-13T09:02:31Z"
    }
