A sub-status monitors only a part of host capabilities. Currently Foreman ships
only two - **build** and **configuration** sub-statuses. Not all sub-statuses
are relevant for all hosts, therefore configuration is only considered if host
is using some configuration management system, e.g. has some Puppet proxy
associated. Build sub-status is relevant for managed hosts and when Foreman is
run in unattended mode.

You can see a global host status with all sub-statuses on the host detail page,
in the properties table. Note that there can be more sub-statuses added by
plugins.

Each sub-status can define own set of possible values that are mapped to three
global status values. Build sub-status has two possible values - **pending**
and **built** that are both mapped to global OK value. Configuration status
is more complicated and its possible values and mappings are described in table
below.

          <td>When there are no reports but the host uses configuration management system (e.g. Puppet proxy is associated) or <em>always_show_configuration_status</em> setting is set to true, it maps to Warning. Otherwise it is mapped to OK.</td>

<sup>1</sup> Reports are identified by an origin and can have different intervals based upon it. For example, reports by Puppet will have 'Puppet' as it's origin and will have it's interval set by <em>puppet_interval</em>.
