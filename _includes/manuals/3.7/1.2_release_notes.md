## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### Plugin translation infrastructure in frontend

With this release it's possible for plugins to use translations in Javascript.
Since the front end is largely moving towards Javascript, this is a great improvement for who care about an internationalized application.
Note that having the infrastructure in place doesn't guarantee everything is translated.

[#36330](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/36330)

#### Puma 6

Puma has been updated to version 6, featuring [improved performance](https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/v6.0.0/6.0-Upgrade.md#improved-performance) compared to Puma 5.

[#36357](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/36357)

### Upgrade warnings

#### Puppet 6 support dropped

After a deprecation in Foreman 3.6, Puppet 6 is no longer supported.
The installer will require at least 7.0.0.
On the Smart Proxy side no changes have been made, but it is still recommended to upgrade.
Note that [Puppet 6 is end of life](https://groups.google.com/g/puppet-announce/c/x4KNOrHevgE) and no longer receives security updates.
