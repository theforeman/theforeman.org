Chef proxy allows proxying of the reports and facts uploads between the chef-client on all your hosts and Foreman.

In order to use this feature, you will need to:

* Use the gem chef_handler_foreman in you chef-client.rb (see [documentation](https://github.com/theforeman/chef-handler-foreman))
* Use the foreman_chef plugin in Foreman for Facts upload (see [documentation](https://github.com/ares/foreman_chef))

You can also authenticate the reports and facts upload. In order to do that, reports and facts are signed with chef-client private key
in chef_handler_foreman plugin. When receiving a report or facts, the smart-proxy retreives the node's public key and check if signature is valid.
This requires:

* the use of chef-server
* a declared client for the smart-proxy with admin rights (to be able to fetch all clients public keys)

#### Configuration

In the smart-proxy settings.yml, you need to:

* enable the chefproxy feature
* configure foreman_url setting

If you want to authenticate reports and facts, you need to:

* enable chef_authenticate_nodes feature
* configure chef_server_url setting (make sure smart-proxy can reach your chef-server)
* configure the chef_smartproxy_clientname: you should set a client with admin rights in chef-server
* configure the chef_smartproxy_privatekey: this key should be the private associated with the chef_smartproxy_clientname and should be readable with smart-proxy user
