* Currently only supports KVM hypervisors.
* VM consoles will be configured by default to listen on 0.0.0.0, change this via *libvirt_default_console_address* in *Administer > Settings > Provisioning*.
* libvirt's DNS and DHCP server (dnsmasq) can be disabled and replaced by BIND and ISC DHCPD (managed by Foreman) by creating a new virtual network and disabling DHCP support.

To connect to the hypervisor using SSH:

1. Configure SSH keys (ssh-keygen) for the 'foreman' user on the Foreman host to connect fully automatically to the remote hypervisor host.
1. Change to the 'foreman' user, test the connection and ensure the remote host has been trusted.
1. If connecting to the hypervisor as a non-root user, set up PolicyKit to permit access to libvirt.  Note that different versions of PolicyKit have different configuration formats.  [1](http://libvirt.org/auth.html#ACL_server_polkit), [2](http://wiki.libvirt.org/page/SSHPolicyKitSetup).
1. Add the compute resource with a URL following one of these examples:
   * `qemu+ssh://root@hypervisor.example.com/system` to use the remote 'root' account
   * `qemu+ssh://hypervisor.example.com/system` to use the remote 'foreman' account

To connect to the hypervisor over TCP without authentication or encryption (not recommended):

1. Set the following options in libvirtd.conf:
   * `listen_tls = 0`
   * `listen_tcp = 1`
   * `auth_tcp = "none"`
1. Enable libvirtd listening, e.g. set `LIBVIRTD_ARGS="--listen"` in /etc/sysconfig/libvirtd
1. Add the compute resource with a URL following this example:
   * `qemu+tcp://hypervisor.example.com:16509/system`

If you have difficulty connecting, test access using the virsh command under the 'foreman' account on the Foreman host first, e.g. `virsh -c qemu+ssh://hypervisor.example.com/system list`.
