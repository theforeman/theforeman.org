Foreman supports auditing of almost all changes that happen within Foreman, from both the UI and from the API. Auditing is done at a user level, and is thus ineffective if _:login:_ is set to _false_, as all audits will be done as the 'admin' user.


#### Basic View


 Got to the Audit tab to see a view of what has changed. This view can be
filtered by the type of change or by the object that was altered (e.g. search
for a hostname to see all changes relating to that host). You also get the
parent object - so if a parameter was modified, you can see what host/group that parameter belongs to. The timestamp of the change and the user who performed it will be listed.


#### Extended Audits for Templates


Template changes also store a diff of the changes, and the ability to roll back to a previous version of the template.
