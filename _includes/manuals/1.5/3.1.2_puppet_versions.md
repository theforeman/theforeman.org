Foreman integrates with Puppet and Facter in a few places, but generally using a recent, stable version will be fine.  The exact versions of Puppet and Facter that Foreman is compatible with are listed below.

The Foreman installer and packages are generally incompatible with Puppet Enterprise, however with some manual reconfiguration, individual Foreman components such as the smart proxy should work if needed (some further unsupported documentation can be found on the wiki).  The installer in particular will conflict with a Puppet Enterprise installation.  It is recommended that Foreman is installed using [Puppet "open source"](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/installation.html).

#### Facter compatibility

Foreman is known to be compatible with all Facter 1.x releases.

For Facter 2.x, both Foreman installer and Foreman 1.4.2 or higher are required.

Compatibility with structured facts in Facter 2.x is being introduced via [#4528](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/4528).
