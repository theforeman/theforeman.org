The Installation Media represents the web URL from where the installation packages can be retrieved (i.e. the OS mirror). Some OS Media is pre-created for you when Foreman is first installed. However, it is best to edit the media you are going to use and ensure the Family is set.

#### New Installation Media

If your OS of choice does not have a mirror pre-created for you, click the *New Medium* button to create one. There are a few variables which can be used to pad out the URL. For example:

    http://mirror.averse.net/centos/$major.$minor/os/$arch

Be sure to set the Family for the Media

#### Assign to Operating System

If you have not already done so, return to the Operating System page for your OS and assign the Media to it now.
