## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

### Upgrade warnings

#### `ct_command` and `fcct_command` settings replaced with `(fc)ct_location` and `(fc)ct_arguments`

To fix [CVE-2022-3874](/security.html#2022-3874) the settings for the CoreOS and Fedora CoreOS
transpiler commands were changed to individual settings for the location of the binary and the
arguments passed to it.
During the upgrade the location of the binaries will be automatically changed to `/usr/bin/ct`
and `/usr/bin/fcct`. Setting the binary location to any other path requires changes to
`settings.yaml`, as different locations are forbidden by default.
The arguments are automatically migrated from the old settings to the new ones.
