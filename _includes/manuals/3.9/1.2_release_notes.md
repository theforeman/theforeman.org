## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### New All Hosts page features

This release introduces an experimental new page that will eventually replace the All Hosts page.
In its first iteration, it includes Host Create and Register buttons, bulk multi-page selection, host deletion, and faster links to each host.
You can try out the new page via 'Show new host overview page' in Settings.
After changing the setting, a full browser page reload is required.
In future releases, more features will be added to the new page, and the old page will eventually be retired.

#### Redis is the default cache type

Default installations will now use Redis configured as the default cache type. Using Redis as the cache has proven to be better performant and does not result in file locking or cache misses.

### Upgrade warnings

#### `ct_command` and `fcct_command` settings replaced with `(fc)ct_location` and `(fc)ct_arguments`

To fix [CVE-2022-3874](/security.html#2022-3874) the settings for the CoreOS and Fedora CoreOS
transpiler commands were changed to individual settings for the location of the binary and the
arguments passed to it.
During the upgrade the location of the binaries will be automatically changed to `/usr/bin/ct`
and `/usr/bin/fcct`. Setting the binary location to any other path requires changes to
`settings.yaml`, as different locations are forbidden by default.
The arguments are automatically migrated from the old settings to the new ones.
