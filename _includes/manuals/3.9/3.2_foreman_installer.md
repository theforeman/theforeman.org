The Foreman installer is a collection of Puppet modules that installs everything required for a full working Foreman setup.  It uses native OS packaging (e.g. RPM and .deb packages) and adds necessary configuration for the complete installation.

Components include the Foreman web UI, Smart Proxy, and optionally TFTP, DNS and DHCP servers.  It is configurable and the Puppet modules can be read or run in "no-op" mode to see what changes it will make.

It's strongly recommended to use the installer instead of only installing packages, as the installer uses OS packages and it saves a lot of time otherwise spent replicating configuration by hand.

By default it will configure:

* Apache HTTP with SSL (using a Puppet-signed certificate)
* Foreman running under Puma (using systemd socket activation)
* Smart Proxy with SSL (using a Puppet-signed certificate) configured for Puppet and TFTP
* Puppetserver
* Puppet agent configured

Other modules can be enabled, which will also configure:

* ISC DHCP server
* BIND DNS server
* TFTP server (under xinetd on Red Hat 7 platforms)

It's recommended to run the installer on a fresh and clean single-purpose system, since the configurations of the aforementioned components is (at least partially) overwritten by the installer.
