This chapter will provide you with information how to backup a Foreman
instance.

#### Database

Run ```foreman-rake db:dump```. It will print a message when it finishes with the dump file location relative to the Foreman root.

#### Configuration

On Red Hat compatible systems issue the following command to backup whole /etc
directory structure:

    tar --selinux -czvf etc_foreman_dir.tar.gz /etc/foreman

For all other distribution do similar command:

    tar -czvf etc_foreman_dir.tar.gz /etc/foreman

#### Puppet server

On the Puppet server node, issue the following command to backup Puppet
certificates on Red Hat compatible systems

    tar --selinux -czvf var_lib_puppet_dir.tar.gz /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl

For all other distribution do similar command:

    tar -czvf var_lib_puppet_dir.tar.gz /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl

Under a Puppet non-AIO installation, back up `/var/lib/puppet/ssl` instead.

#### DHCP, DNS and TFTP services

Depending on used software packages, perform backup of important data and
configuration files according to the documentation. For ISC DHCP and DNS
software, these are located within /etc and /var directories depending on your
distribution as well as TFTP service.
