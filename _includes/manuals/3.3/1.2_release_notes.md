## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

### Upgrade warnings

#### Disabling unattended mode dropped

Running Foreman with setting `unattended: false` is dropped.
Every Foreman instance is now effectively running with this setting on.
For more details and discussion read [the RFC](https://community.theforeman.org/t/rfc-remove-unattended-setting/10035).

### Deprecations

BMC credentials access through ENC YAML output and templates is turned off by default for increased security. To turn it on, go to Administer - Settings and turn the "BMC credentials access" setting on.

We've updated our browsers compatibility to support the following:

* Google Chrome - latest version
* Microsoft Edge - latest version
* Apple Safari - latest version
* Mozilla Firefox - latest version
* Mozilla Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) - latest version
