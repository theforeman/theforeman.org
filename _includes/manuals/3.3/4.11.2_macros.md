For report templates, it's useful to access more data from database than in regular
provisioning templates. Typically it's needed to load all hosts matching some search
query. If safe mode rendering is enabled, access to internal objects is restricted.
Foreman provides resource loading macros such as load_hosts. They all have following
behaviors and capabilities:

* accepts search keyword to limit what resources should be loaded
* accepts include keyword to specify associated objects that should be eager loaded
* load data in batches
* authorize the resources based on current user permissions

Consider following example:

```
<%- load_hosts(search: 'name ~ example.com').each_record do |host| -%>
<%=   host.name %>,<%= host.mac %>
<%- end -%>
```

It loads all hosts that contains domain example.com in their name. If it's more than
1,000 hosts, it will trigger separate SQL query for each thousand automatically. Then
it iterates over all found hosts and print comma separated pair of host name and MAC
address. The query will return only hosts that current user has view_hosts permission
for.

For more examples see default report templates.
