Foreman is a Rails application. While Rails supports different databases, Foreman supports only PostgreSQL for production deployments.

The database configuration file can be found at:

<pre>/etc/foreman/database.yml</pre>

<div class="alert alert-info">When using PostgreSQL, you should make sure that the foreman-postgresql package is installed. See <a href="manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.3InstallFromPackages">3.3 Install From Packages</a>.</div>

Edit your config/database.yml and modify:
{% highlight yaml %}
production:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: foreman
  username: foreman
  password: password
  host: localhost
{% endhighlight %}

#### Switching from SQLite/MySQL to PostgreSQL while maintaining existing data

Previous versions of Foreman supported additional databases. Users who are migrating from SQLite or MySQL should perform the steps in <a href="manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.7MigratingtoPostgreSQL">3.7 Migrating to PostgreSQL</a> prior to upgrading Foreman to 2.0.
