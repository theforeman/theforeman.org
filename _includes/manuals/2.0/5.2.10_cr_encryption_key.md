Compute resource passwords and secrets are stored on the Foreman database using a secret - the encryption key - and ciphered using AES-256-CBC.
The encryption key can usually be found in `/etc/foreman/encryption_key.rb`, which is symlinked to `/usr/share/foreman/config/initializers/encryption_key.rb`. The value of the ENCRYPTION_KEY variable must be at least 32 bytes long.

If you want to regenerate the key, you can run `foreman-rake security:generate_encryption_key`. Please remember that previously encrypted passwords cannot be decrypted with a different encryption key, so decrypt all passwords before changing your encryption key.

After you make sure you have a valid encryption key, you can encrypt your Compute Resource secrets in the database by running `foreman-rake db:compute_resources:encrypt`.
To unencrypt them, run the task `foreman-rake db:compute_resources:decrypt`.

Keep in mind passwords are encrypted in the Foreman database, but Foreman will decrypt them and use unencrypted credentials to authenticate to Compute Resources.
