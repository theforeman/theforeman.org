Foreman is packaged for the following RPM based distributions:

* RHEL and derivatives, version 7

For most users, it's highly recommended to use the [installer](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.2ForemanInstaller) as the packages only provide the software and a standalone Foreman service.  The installer installs these packages, then additionally configures Foreman to run under Apache and Passenger with PostgreSQL, plus can configure a complete Puppet setup integrated with Foreman.

#### Pre-requisites: EPEL

All RHEL and derivatives must be [subscribed to EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) to provide additional dependencies.  Install epel-release from [here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F) to automatically configure it.

#### Pre-requisites: Software collections
All RHEL and derivatives require software collections from the CentOS SCLorg Special Interest Group (SIG). Foreman uses the `rh-ruby25` collection - which is from RHSCL.

Generally we recommend all users to use the CentOS SCLorg SIG's builds, which can be configured by installing the `foreman-release-scl` package from our repositories (which in turn installs the `centos-release-scl-rh` package). The Foreman installer will use this package by default.

It is also possible to obtain rh-ruby25 from other sources below. These sources are noted only for completeness:

1. CentOS SCLo SIG: `yum install centos-release-scl-rh` to configure from CentOS Extras, or [sclo on mirror.centos.org](http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/sclo/x86_64/rh/) ([docs](https://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/SCL))
1. Oracle Linux: [Software Collection Library documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E59096/html/index.html)
1. RHEL: customers can access RHSCL as a separate repository or child channel (`rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms`)
1. Scientific Linux: [softwarecollections on ftp.scientificlinux.org](http://ftp.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/6x/external_products/softwarecollections/)

#### Pre-requisites: Optional repo (RHEL only)

RHEL 7 hosts must also be subscribed to the RHEL 7 Optional repository or child channel in RHN.

To enable the optional repository on a RHEL 7 system using subscription-manager, run:

    yum-config-manager --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms

#### Pre-requisites: Puppet

It's recommended to configure the Puppet Labs repositories to obtain the latest version of Puppet available, instead of the version on EPEL. Either the 3.x open source repository or the Puppet Collection (PC1) repository may be configured:

* [Using Puppet Collections: Yum-based Systems](https://docs.puppet.com/guides/puppetlabs_package_repositories.html#yum-based-systems) (Puppet 4)
* [Pre-4.0 Open Source Repositories: Yum-based Systems](https://docs.puppet.com/guides/puppetlabs_package_repositories.html#yum-based-systems-repository) (Puppet 3)

#### Available repositories

Four main repos are provided at <http://yum.theforeman.org>:

* `/releases/latest` or `/releases/VERSION` (e.g. `/releases/{{page.version}}`) carries the stable releases and updates of Foreman and its dependencies.
* `/rc` carries release candidates only in the few weeks prior to a release.  Ensure after a release is made that you use the main releases repo instead.
* `/nightly` carries the latest development builds and as such, may be unstable or occasionally broken.
* `/plugins` or `/plugins/VERSION` (e.g. `/plugins/{{page.version}}`) carries the stable plugin releases.

Under each repo are directories for each distribution, then each architecture.

#### Release packages

To set up the repository, foreman-release packages are provided which add a repo definition to `/etc/yum.repos.d`.  Install the appropriate release RPM from these lists:

    yum localinstall https://yum.theforeman.org/releases/{{page.version}}/el7/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm

For release candidate or nightly RPMs, change the URL as appropriate based on the above list of available repositories.

#### Signing

Release and release candidate packages are signed by the per-release key listed on [Security](security.html#GPGkeys).  Nightly packages are not signed.

    foreman               Foreman server
