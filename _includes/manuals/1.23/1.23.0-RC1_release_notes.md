### Deprecations

* Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) is deprecated and will no longer be supported starting from Foreman 1.25. Users are urged to upgrade their base OS to Ubuntu Bionic (18.04).
* [#27048](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27048) Smart Proxy DNS module methods `get_name, get_name!, get_ipv4_address, get_ipv4_address!, get_ipv6_address, get_ipv6_address!, get_resource_as_string, get_resource_as_string!` were marked as deprecated and scheduled for removal in 1.24. They have been unused in the Smart Proxy since 1.16 but kept around for plugins. If you're a Smart Proxy DNS Plugin author, make sure you migrate away from them before 1.24.

### Upgrade warnings

* [#27047](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27047) The Smart Proxy DNS module method `dns_find` was removed after being deprecated in 1.14. Using the function generated a warning in the logs but the common providers (built in, Route53, PowerDNS) have been upgraded and no user impact is expected.
* [#27047](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27047) The Smart Proxy DNS module method behavior `ptr_record_conflicts` changed and no longer accepts strings. This was deprecated in 1.16 and generated warnings in the logs. The common providers (built in, Route53, PowerDNS) have been upgraded and no user impact is expected.
* [#27055](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27055) The schema (HTTP/HTTPS) of `unattended_url` setting now affects whether the provisioning templates are available through HTTP. When the `unattended_url` uses the HTTPS schema, retrieving provisioning/userdata templates via HTTP is unsupported behaviour as of Foreman 1.23. Retrieval via HTTPS is allowed regardless of the setting's scheme.
* [#26092](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26092) If only one organization or location is configured in Foreman, all resources created via the API will now be assigned to the organization or location automatically even if they aren't specified in the request.
* [#27233](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27233) If fact import for a host leads to creation of a new domain or puppet environment, the newly created resource will be assigned to the host's location and organization automatically. Existing resources will not be modified and may still lead to mismatches if they aren't assigned to the proper taxonomies.
* [#27264](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27264) Adds an `ansible-runner` repository as dependecy to the ansible smart proxy plugin. This causes `python2-psutil` upgrade to version `5.x`. You can disable the repository by an parameter `manage_runner_repo`.
