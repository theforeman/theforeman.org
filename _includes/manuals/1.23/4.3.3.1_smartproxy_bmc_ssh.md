The SSH BMC provider provides a limited level of BMC functionality by running commands over an SSH connection to the host using a trusted SSH key.

It has the following configuration options for authentication, for the remote SSH user and private SSH key:

    :bmc_ssh_user: root
    :bmc_ssh_key: /usr/share/foreman/.ssh/id_rsa

The following configuration options control the commands executed by the provider on the remote host:

    :bmc_ssh_powerstatus: "true"
    :bmc_ssh_powercycle: "shutdown -r +1"
    :bmc_ssh_poweroff: "shutdown +1"
    :bmc_ssh_poweron: "false"

No power on support is possible with this provider.
