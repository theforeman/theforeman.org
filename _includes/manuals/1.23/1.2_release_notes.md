## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features

#### New Login Page

After a very long time, our login page got a face-lift. The background was selected after receiving feedback from the community via our community survey as well as a long discussion on our [community forum](https://community.theforeman.org/t/our-new-login-page/11827) - which serves as a great reminder that you too can influence the direction of the project by taking part in our annual survey and regular discussions! ([#24990](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/24990))

#### Foreman Userdata plugin has been merged into Foreman Core

 Foreman now introduces a new template kind "cloud-init", which previously required using the userdata plugin. When configured, cloud-init capable hosts can reach out to Foreman to download the seed data via HTTP(s). This will work in any environment as long as cloud-init has been pre-configured in the image and the provisioned node can reach out to Foreman via HTTP(s). Note this is complementary to the existing "user-data" template kind. ([#24881](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/24881))

#### Impersonation capability added

It is sometimes useful for system administrators to be able to see the interface as a different user, for example when trying to debug issues. A new impersonation capability is now available that allows the administrator to switch to a different user account on the fly without requiring knowledge of the user's password. ([#26003](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26003))

#### Multiple improvements to GCE compute resource

Following restoring the ability to provision to GCE, multiple issues with the GCE integration were found and fixed. Some highlights include VM power management ([#26814](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26814) and [#26812](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26812)), read-only console output view ([#26787](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26787)), and associating vms ([#26761](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26761)).

#### Javascript stack improvements
The UI team has been hard at work behind the scenes at making our new React-based Javascript stack more stable and useful for plugins. Some highlights include ability to extend react components from plugins ([#25756](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/25756)), extracting some common JS libraries to a module that can be shared with plugins ([#27074](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27074)), and adding React Router foundations for client-side routing ([#26186](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26186), [#26696](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26696), [#26753](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26753), [#26805](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26805)).

#### Experimental Redis cache support
Redis has been added as an experimental caching backend for Foreman instead of the default file-based store, or the memcache-based store which requires an additional plugin. It is still missing installer support and documentation - contributions are most welcome! ([#26918](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26918))

*A full list of changes in 1.23.0 is available via [Redmine](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues?set_filter=1&sort=id%3Adesc&status_id=closed&f[]=cf_12&op[cf_12]=%3D&v[cf_12][]=1023)*

### Deprecations

* Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) is deprecated and will no longer be supported starting from Foreman 1.25. Users are urged to upgrade their base OS to Ubuntu Bionic (18.04).
* [#27048](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27048) Smart Proxy DNS module methods `get_name, get_name!, get_ipv4_address, get_ipv4_address!, get_ipv6_address, get_ipv6_address!, get_resource_as_string, get_resource_as_string!` were marked as deprecated and scheduled for removal in 1.24. They have been unused in the Smart Proxy since 1.16 but kept around for plugins. If you're a Smart Proxy DNS Plugin author, make sure you migrate away from them before 1.24.

### Upgrade warnings

* [#27047](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27047) The Smart Proxy DNS module method `dns_find` was removed after being deprecated in 1.14. Using the function generated a warning in the logs but the common providers (built in, Route53, PowerDNS) have been upgraded and no user impact is expected.
* [#27047](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27047) The Smart Proxy DNS module method behavior `ptr_record_conflicts` changed and no longer accepts strings. This was deprecated in 1.16 and generated warnings in the logs. The common providers (built in, Route53, PowerDNS) have been upgraded and no user impact is expected.
* [#27055](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27055) The schema (HTTP/HTTPS) of `unattended_url` setting now affects whether the provisioning templates are available through HTTP. When the `unattended_url` uses the HTTPS schema, retrieving provisioning/userdata templates via HTTP is unsupported behaviour as of Foreman 1.23. Retrieval via HTTPS is allowed regardless of the setting's scheme.
* [#26092](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26092) If only one organization or location is configured in Foreman, all resources created via the API will now be assigned to the organization or location automatically even if they aren't specified in the request.
* [#27233](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27233) If fact import for a host leads to creation of a new domain or puppet environment, the newly created resource will be assigned to the host's location and organization automatically. Existing resources will not be modified and may still lead to mismatches if they aren't assigned to the proper taxonomies.
* [#27264](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27264) The installer will add the [ansible-runner](https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-runner/) repository when installing the Ansible Smart Proxy Plugin. Users handling their own repositories can disable this by passing `--foreman-proxy-plugin-ansible-manage-runner-repo false` to the installer. Passing `--foreman-proxy-plugin-ansible-install-runner false` completely disables installing `ansible-runner`. Note that the EL7 repository contains `python2-psutil` version `5.x` which overwrites EPEL's version `2.x`.
* [#24881](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/24881) The [foreman_userdata](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_userdata) plugin has been integrated in Foreman. The plugin package has been removed and Foreman obsoletes it so upgrades are automatic, but any scripts that may rely on its presence may start to fail. For users of [puppet-foreman](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman) this includes the `foreman::plugin::userdata` class.
* [#27296](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27296) The repository handling in the Puppet provisioning templates has been refactored to reflect [changes in the official Puppet repositories](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/puppet-dev/19brLt5MuDw). This means the PC1 repository containing Puppet 4 has been removed and the `enable-puppetlabs-pc1-repo` parameter no longer exists. In turn a `enable-puppetlabs-puppet6-repo` was added but with [an incorrect repository name](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27822). This will be resolved in 1.23.1 and can also be manually applied. The `enable-puppetlabs-repo` parameter has changed in meaning on the repository side and is now a rolling release containing the latest stable version. At the time of writing this is Puppet 6. There is no support for using [release-archives.puppet.com](http://release-archives.puppet.com/).
