The FreeIPA server can be used as an authentication provider for Foreman's standard logon form. We assume the Foreman machine is already FreeIPA-enrolled so sssd is configured to be able to facilitate the authentication, and we have PAM service *foreman-prod* configured.

We will install the necessary Apache modules:
{% highlight bash %}
yum install -y mod_intercept_form_submit mod_authnz_pam
{% endhighlight %}

We will then configure Apache to perform PAM authentication (and access control check) using the PAM service *foreman-prod*, for example in configuration file `/etc/httpd/conf.d/intercept_form_submit.conf`:
{% highlight text %}
LoadModule intercept_form_submit_module modules/mod_intercept_form_submit.so
LoadModule authnz_pam_module modules/mod_authnz_pam.so
<Location /users/login>
  InterceptFormPAMService foreman-prod
  InterceptFormLogin login[login]
  InterceptFormPassword login[password]
</Location>
{% endhighlight %}

After restarting Apache with ``service httpd restart``, you should be able to log in to Foreman's WebUI as existing user, using password from the FreeIPA server. Please note that **intercept_form_submit_module** uses **authnz_pam_module** to run not just the authentication, but access check as well. If the authentication does not pass and you are sure you use the correct password, check also that the user is allowed access in FreeIPA HBAC rules.
