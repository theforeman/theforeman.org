We suppose that the Foreman machine is FreeIPA-enrolled and `HTTP/<the-foreman-fqdn>` service has been created on FreeIPA server.

At first we create HBAC (host-based access control) service and rule on the FreeIPA server. In the following examples, we will use the PAM service name *foreman-prod*.

On the FreeIPA server, we define the HBAC service and rule and link them together:

{% highlight bash %}
ipa hbacsvc-add foreman-prod
ipa hbacrule-add allow_foreman_prod
ipa hbacrule-add-service allow_foreman_prod --hbacsvcs=foreman-prod
{% endhighlight %}

Then we add user we wish to have access to the service *foreman-prod*, and the hostname of our Foreman server:
{% highlight bash %}
ipa hbacrule-add-user allow_foreman_prod --user=<username>
ipa hbacrule-add-host allow_foreman_prod --hosts=<the-foreman-fqdn>
{% endhighlight %}

Alternatively, host groups and user groups could be added to the *allow_foreman_prod* rule.

At any point of the configuration, we can check the status of the rule:
{% highlight bash %}
ipa hbacrule-find foreman-prod
ipa hbactest --user=<username> --host=<the-foreman-fqdn> --service=foreman-prod
{% endhighlight %}

Chances are there will be HBAC rule *allow_all* matching besides our new *allow_foreman_prod* rule. See http://www.freeipa.org/page/Howto/HBAC_and_allow_all for steps to disable the catchall *allow_all* HBAC rule while maintaining the correct operation of your FreeIPA server and enrolled clients. The goal is only *allow_foreman_prod* matching when checked with `ipa hbactest`.
