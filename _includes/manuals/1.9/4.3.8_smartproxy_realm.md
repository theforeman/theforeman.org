Activate the realm management module within the Smart Proxy instance.  This manages Kerberos realms or domains, allowing Foreman to add and remove hosts to enable them to join the realm/domain automatically during provisioning.

<pre>
:enabled: https
:realm_provider: freeipa
</pre>

`freeipa` is the only provider currently available.

The following settings control authentication of the proxy to the realm for management of hosts:
<pre>
# Authentication for Kerberos-based Realms
:realm_keytab: /etc/foreman-proxy/freeipa.keytab
:realm_principal: realm-proxy@EXAMPLE.COM
</pre>
