The following operating systems are supported by the installer, have packages and are tested for deploying Foreman:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or 7
  * [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F) is required
  * Enable the Optional and RHSCL 1 repositories/channels:
    * `yum-config-manager --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms rhel-server-rhscl-6-rpms`
    * check the above repositories because the command can silently fail when subscription does not provide it: `yum repolist`
  * Apply all SELinux-related erratas.
* CentOS, Scientific Linux or Oracle Linux 6 or 7
  * [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F) is required
* Fedora 19
* Debian 8 (Jessie)
* Debian 7 (Wheezy)
* Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)
* Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise)

It is recommended to apply all OS updates if possible.

All platforms will require Puppet 2.7 or higher.  Puppet 3.x is supported and may be installed from the Puppet Labs repositories.

Other operating systems will need to use alternative installation methods, such as from source.

* RHEL and derivatives (CentOS, Scientific Linux, Oracle Linux) 3+
