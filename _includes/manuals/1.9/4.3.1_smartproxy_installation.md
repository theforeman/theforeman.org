A smart proxy is an autonomous web-based foreman component that is placed on a host performing a specific function in the host commissioning phase.
It receives requests from Foreman to perform operations that are required
during the commissioning process and executes them on its behalf. More details
can be found on the [**Foreman Architecture**](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#ForemanArchitecture) page.

To fully manage the commissioning process then a smart proxy will have to manipulate these services, DHCP, DNS, Puppet CA, Puppet and TFTP. These services may exist on separate machines or several of them may be hosted on the same machine. As each smart proxy instance is capable of managing all the of these services, there is only need for one proxy per host.
In the special case of a smart proxy managing a windows DHCP server, the host machine must be running Windows and support the **netsh dhcp** utility, it does not need to be the Microsoft DHCP server itself.

#### Packages

RPM and Debian packages are available, see the [Install from Packages](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.3InstallFromPackages) section for configuration and install the `foreman-proxy` package.

#### Source code

You can get the latest stable code from [GitHub](https://github.com/theforeman/smart-proxy) ([via git](git://github.com/theforeman/smart-proxy.git)).

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/theforeman/smart-proxy.git
</pre>

#### Windows
In Windows, the installation steps are different. You need to run smart-proxy from the source as well as install Ruby and Ruby DevKit

1. Install [Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) with matching and DevKit to compile native extensions. Make sure to add Ruby to `%PATH%`
2. Download / clone the smart-proxy repository to a convenient location
2. Open a command prompt (`cmd.exe`) and run the following commands in order:
  3. `ruby <devKirRoot\dk.rb init`
  4. `ruby <devKirRoot\dk.rb install`
  5. `gem install bundler`
  6. `cd <smart-proxy location`
  7. `bundle install`

__Hint:__ If you have puppet installed on the same host running smart-proxy, you can use Puppet's Ruby. In this case, just add directory containing `ruby.exe` to your path variable and change DevKit settings if necessary.

#### Configuration file

Usually can be found at /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml or in the config/settings.yml subdirectory.
You can use the *settings.yml.example* file inside the *config* directory as a template for your own *settings.yml*.

Configuration of each subsystem is usually in /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/ or in the config/settings.d/ subdirectory.  If you don't plan to use one of the subsystems, please disable them in these configuration files. For more information see [**Smartproxy Configuration**](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.3.2SmartProxySettings).

#### Start the daemon

<pre>
bin/smart-proxy
</pre>

Or if you installed it via a package simply start the foreman-proxy service.

<pre>
service foreman-proxy start
</pre>

#### Add the Smart Proxy to Foreman

* Go to Foreman, under *Infrastructure > Smart proxies*, click *New Proxy*
* Type in the Name for your Proxy and the URL of your Proxy, with the port used

For example:

* Name: Puppet-Proxy
* URL: http://puppet.your-domain.com:8443
