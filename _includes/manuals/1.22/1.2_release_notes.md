## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features

#### Array, Boolean and other types support in Parameters

Global parameters now support the same types as smart variables and smart class parameters.
As a part of this change searching by parameter value is no longer allowed. ([#4127](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/4127))

#### Compute resource libraries update
Multiple libraries used for connecting to the various compute resources have been updated to use newer versions ([#26024](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26024), [#25449](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/25449), [#26025](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26025), [#26362](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26362), [#26423](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26423)). Please report any issues found during interaction with compute resources on [our issue tracker](https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/issues/new).

#### Google Compute Resource

Google compute resource has been fixed now. It was previously not functional due to changes in Google compute APIs. `cloud-init` integration has also been added to Google compute resource. There are still a few edge cases which need to be handled, but basic provisioning should be functional. ([#26473](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26473), [#26496](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26496))

#### Graphql API
The 1.22 release of Foreman now contains a new, experimental, API based on [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). Graphql allows clients to ask for specific data which can reduce round trips. Future releases will add more queries to the API. The docs have been updated [with example queries]({{ page.url }}#5111-using-graphql).

#### Smart Proxy Exposed Capabilities and Settings

The Smart Proxy now provides a v2 features API allowing proxy plugins to declare capabilities and expose settings from their configuration. The Foreman server has been updated to use this new API and store the declared capabitlities and settings.  These will be used in the future to enhance and simplify our interactions with the Smart Proxy. ([#25614](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/25614), [#25642](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/25642))

### Deprecations
* Passing `:confirm` option to `link_to` helper is deprecated and will be removed in 1.24. Please pass it as `data: { confirm: "confirmation text" }` instead. Plugin maintainers should update any usage of the `link_to` helper in their code accordingly.
* The foreman_docker plugin has been deprecated and is no longer supported. See the [Readme](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_docker/blob/master/README.md) file for removal instructions.

### Upgrade warnings

* With types support in global parameters, searching by parameter value is no longer allowed.
* Logger named `blob` where template contents is rendered caused excessive log file growth and has been disabled by default. Enable it via `settings.yaml` or foreman-installer if needed.
* Puppet 4 support has been dropped from the installer. Please use Puppet 5 or newer for installing or upgrading Foreman. Clients running Puppet 4 should still be able to report to Foreman. Please note Puppet 4 is EOL since December 2018 and Puppet 4 client support in Foreman is now deprecated.
