The smart proxy's logs module provides an API to retrieve recently logged messages and information about failed modules.  This will be displayed in Foreman under the Smart Proxy pages when the module is enabled.

The module has no configuration options of its own, and is just enabled by configuring `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/logs.yml`:

    :enabled: https

Once enabled, restart the foreman-proxy service and refresh the features on your Foreman server.

The number of logs is controlled by the main smart proxy logging settings, detailed in [Smart Proxy Settings](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.3.2SmartProxySettings).
