It is required that this procedure is executed as an administrator.

It is not required that the smart proxy be on the same host as the MS DHCP server. The smart proxy just needs to be on a Windows host with connectivity to the DHCP server. If this is the case, make sure the smart proxy service runs as a user with sufficient privileges.

__Note:__ Refer to the [installation guide](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.3.1SmartProxyInstallation) for general setup.

1. Edit config/settings.d/dhcp.yml so that it looks a bit like this. `:server:` can be left commented out if smart proxy runs on the same host.

    _Sample config/settings.d/dhcp.yml file_

       ---
       # Can be true, false, or http/https to enable just one of the protocols
       :enabled: https
       :use_provider: dhcp_native_ms
       :server: 10.10.10.1

2. If needed, you have to create the option 60 on the Windows DHCP (for PXE Boot)

    - Open an administrator command prompt
    - Create the PXE Option using netsh

          C:\Windows\system32>netsh
          netsh>dhcp
          netsh dhcp> server 10.10.10.1
          netsh dhcp server>add optiondef 60 PXEClient String 0 comment= PXE Support
