## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### Greatly decreased JavaScript size for plugins

Previously, Foreman's whole JavaScript bundle was duplicated in every plugin.
Now a separate bundle is generated that Foreman and each plugin can reuse.
In most plugins, we saw a 2 to 3 MB reduction in size.
Depending on the number of plugins, this can save a significant amount in transfer size.
While Foreman does compress and cache these JavaScript bundles, they still had to be loaded all the time.

For more details, see https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/37252 and https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/37391.

#### Running Foreman on Enterprise Linux 9 is fully supported

Foreman 3.10 only supported Enterprise Linux 9 as experimental, but with this release it is fully supported.

### Upgrade warnings

#### keycloak-httpd-client-install dropped from Enterprise Linux 9

Foreman has shipped its own `keycloak-httpd-client-install` package because initially the version shipped in Enterprise Linux 7 was too old to support ODIC.
Recently it was noticed that the version in Enterprise Linux 8 contains the required features but still contains a https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-31496[packaging bug].
The version in Enterprise Linux 9 contains all the required features but is older than what Foreman has shipped.
Foreman 3.10 was the first release on Enterprise Linux 9 and it was marked as experimental.
As a result, the decision has been made to remove it from Foreman's Enterprise Linux 9 packaging.
Users who have this package installed should downgrade it using `dnf downgrade keycloak-httpd-client-install`.

For more details, see https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/37334.

### Deprecations

#### Running Foreman on Enterprise Linux 8 removal in Foreman 3.13

Now that running on Enterprise Linux 9 is fully supported, running on Enterprise Linux 8 is deprecated.
Foreman 3.13 will drop this support so users are encouraged to plan their upgrade.

Note this is for running Foreman itself.
Clients will remain supported.

For more details and discussion, see https://community.theforeman.org/t/drop-support-for-running-on-el8-with-foreman-3-13/38083.
