Requirements for the foreman core component

* Puppet >= 0.24-4
* rake >= 0.84
* rubygems
* ruby-sqlite3 (libsqlite3-ruby) if you are going to use sqlite as your database
* git (if installing from source )
* ruby-libvirt (epel-repo, only for develop branch)

The installation has been successfully tested on RHEL[5,6], Fedora[13,14,15,16,17], Debian Linux 6.0 (Squeeze) and Ubuntu Linux 12.04 (the community has reported varying success with other Debian/Ubuntu versions - 12.10 seems fine for example). For older operating systems you might need additional packages (e.g. sqlite).

It is also known to work on Solaris and Mac.
