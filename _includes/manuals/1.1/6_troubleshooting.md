There are two primary methods of getting support for the Foreman: IRC and mailing lists.

### IRC
We work on the [irc.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/) servers. You can get general support in #theforeman, while development chat takes place in #theforeman-dev.

### Mailing lists
Mailing lists are available via Google Groups. Much like IRC, we have a general users (support, Q/A, etc) lists and a development list:

* [foreman-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/foreman-users)
* [foreman-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/foreman-users)
