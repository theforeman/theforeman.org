### Upgrade notes

Upgrades from previous versions of Foreman are mostly automatic when using packages, but there are some important notes to ensure things go as smoothly as possible.

#### Key features and improvements

Here are some of the most prominent features of Foreman 1.1

* Support for Puppet 3
* Locations & organizations - http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/LocationsAndOrganizations
* Parameterized classes - http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Parameterized_class_support
* V1 of a robust, versioned API - http://theforeman.org/api.html

#### Authentication for puppetmasters

By default, the external nodes (ENC) interface and reports+fact import interfaces will now only permit hosts with smart proxies registered and will require client SSL certs to verify.  The defaults are all enabled to provide the most secure config out of the box, which can be relaxed if necessary - see below.

##### Full HTTPS and Smart Proxies

For most users with Apache, mod_ssl and Passenger (the standard foreman-installer configuration), plus Foreman proxy on the puppetmaster host:

1. Update the ENC script
   [node.rb](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman/blob/master/templates/external_node.rb.erb)
and report processor
[foreman.rb](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman/blob/master/templates/foreman-report.rb.erb) using the foreman-installer, or copy its templates and update:


2. It's highly recommended that you have require_ssl and login set to
   true in `/etc/foreman/settings.yaml`.

This relies on mod_ssl verifying the client's SSL cert with the CA
configured for Foreman.  If everything's in the same Puppet CA
infrastructure, this should work.  For nginx users, see
[Setting up Nginx +
Passenger](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Setting_up_Nginx_+_Passenger_) an updated configuration.

##### No HTTPS, only Smart Proxy host auth

If you don't use SSL, or you have a complex puppetmaster SSL setup (multiple CAs), you might decide to relax client SSL cert requirements.

1. Disable the "require_ssl_puppetmasters" setting in the Foreman UI (More, Settings, Auth).  This will fall back to permitting any connections from registered puppetmaster smart proxy hosts.

##### No authentication, no Smart Proxy

Lastly, if you want to permit any access to these interfaces - which will enable remote code execution on your Foreman server(!) - you can disable "restrict_registered_puppetmasters" in Settings. 

##### More information and support

More detailed documentation is available in the manual, under [Securing
Communications with
SSL](http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.1/index.html#5.4SecuringCommunicationswithSSL.)
We appreciate it's a difficult change, but is necessary to improve the
security of the application.  If you have problems, do check the
troubleshooting text in the manual, and do contact one of the
[Support](http://localhost:4000/manuals/1.1/index.html#6.Troubleshooting) channels.

#### Yum and Debian repos

#### Yum

As per the new yum repo structure, you can always get the latest version of Foreman 1.1 from http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.1. A redirect from http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/latest/ to the most recently released stable version is also a good way to be able to upgrade across major versions without have to upgrade the baseurl. Packages are available for EL5, EL6, Fedora 16, and Fedora 17*; each distro has its own subtree in the repo, so pick whichever matches your distribution and architecture.

##### Debian

Unlike previous releases, the 1.0 packages are still available in the repository in addition to the new 1.1 packages because of a recent change in repo management tools. Instructions for setting up the Debian repo for your system are available on http://deb.theforeman.org/.

[*]: there is a known issue with installation on Fedora 17 that will be fixed very soon.

#### Deprecation: ActiveRecord-based storeconfigs / database sharing

Previously it was suggested that a single database could be shared
between Puppet ActiveRecord-based storeconfigs and Foreman, which would
be used to import data from Puppet - this configuration has now been
deprecated.  The current recommendation is to use a standalone database
for Foreman, then configure either an ENC, which provides most of the
same functionality as database sharing without the associated issues.

Puppet 3 also deprecated the use of ActiveRecord-based storeconfigs and it is now recommended to use PuppetDB instead for storeconfigs and exported resources.  This can be used alongside Foreman - the two don't need to interact, and reports are sent to both systems.

* Improved the Foreman functionality to load the default Puppet settings to work with Puppet 3
* Fixed $vardir also has to be set or in order for the Puppet configuration loader
* Fixed Puppet 3 class and environment import 

Notes:

* The Foreman installer has been updated, but for other users, ensure
sudo rules allow access to `/usr/bin/puppet cert *` now instead of
`/usr/sbin/puppetca` and `/usr/bin/puppet kick *` instead of
`/usr/sbin/puppetrun`.
* For non-standard puppet.conf locations (including Puppet Enterprise),
ensure that `:puppetconfdir` is set correctly in `config/settings.yaml` to either the config directory or puppet.conf itself.

##### Locations and organizations

Locations and organizations can be used to classify most of the different objects in Foreman, including hosts, domains, host groups, users, and more. They can be enabled individually or together, so if a user only needs locations (for example), they don't have to have organizations enabled. Locations and organizations are disabled by default. 

To locations or organizations set "locations_enabled: true" and/or "organizations_enabled: true". 

* Added location and organization support
* Numerous changes to caching logic in the topbar to allow existing Foreman installations to view the context switchers
* Fixed scoping bugs that users running git-based deployments found while using locations and orgs

##### Trends

A new page was added for trending of different facts. This feature will allow for trending of hosts over time, instead of displaying a point-in-time display of hosts like the statistics page.

* Fixed temp dirs on Fedora, permissions to fix failure to log

* Added support for retrieving a user's role via the API
* Authenticate API calls via REMOTE_USER
* Support for multiple API versions in prearation for V2 using an accept-header

*A full list of bugs and feature changes in 1.1 is available at http://theforeman.org/versions/show/20*
