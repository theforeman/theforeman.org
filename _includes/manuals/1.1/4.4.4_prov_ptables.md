Partition templates are a subset of normal Provisioning Templates. They are handled separately because it is frequently the case that an admin wants to deploy the same host template (packages, services, etc) with just a different harddisk layout to account for different servers' capabilities.

Foreman comes with pre-created templates for common Operating Systems, but it is good to edit the template, check it's content and it's Family setting. If the Family is wrong, be sure to go back to Operating Systems and associate it with your Operating System.

#### Dynamic Partition tables

When creating a new Host, you will be given the option to create a Dynamic Partition table. This is essentially a 'one-off' partition table that is stored with the host and used only for that host. It replaces the choice of Partition Table from the normal list of those associated with the selected OS.
