Provisioning Windows is a two step process. The first step, creating Installation Media, is not discussed here.
The necessary boot files are are later downloaded by automatically by smart proxy.

##### Tasks break down
- Change / add a new Architecture and OS
- Edit provision templates
- Add installation media
- Edit partition table
- Add parameters
- Link provisioning templates to OS

##### Architecture and OS
In _Hosts > Architectures_ add a new architecture:

- Name: `x64`

Add a new OS in _Hosts > Operating systems_ if needed.
If you already have Windows hosts and with Puppet installed, the correct OS and architecture will have been auto created already.
This example covers Windows 8.1 / Windows Server 2012R2.

![Add new OS](/static/images/screenshots/4.4.8.3_prov_win_os.png "Adding Windows 8 OS in Foreman")

- Name: `windows`
- Major: `6`
- Minor: `3`
- OS family: `windows`
- Description: `Windows8`
- Root password hash: `Base64`
- Architectures: `x64`

Take special care to set __Root password hash = `Base64`__. The templates do not render correctly if this is set otherwise.
Changing the encoding does not [apply do existing hosts](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.5.2ConfigurationOptions)

##### Add provision templates
Head to _Hosts > Provisioning Templates_ and edit the templates starting with `WAIK` to meet your needs. Make sure to get the latest version of the WAIK templates from the [community templates project](https://github.com/theforeman/community-templates)
Assign each of those templates to your Windows OS (does not apply to snippets).
The naming of the templates is a suggestion and up to you. This does __not__ apply to snippets! There, the name is important.

__Note:__ You can find more info about [Foreman Template Writing in the Wiki](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/TemplateWriting).

##### Required templates
- WAIK Finish
  - Name: `WAIK Finish`
  - Kind: `finish`

- WAIK unattend.xml
  - Name: `WAIK unattend.xml`
  - Kind: Provision

- WAIK peSetup.cmd
  - Name: `WAIK peSetup.cmd`
  - Kind: `script`

__Note:__ To get the download folders nicely, the `wget` commands in this template might need tweaking. This could
especially be necessary if you intend to use the `extraFinishCommands` snippet.
Eg, `--cut-dirs=3` would cut the first three directories form the download path when saving locally.
This way `http://winmirror.domain.com/pub/win81x64/extras/puppet.msi` will be stripped of `pub/win81x64/extras` and download to `puppet.msi`.

- WAIK PXELinux
  - Name: `WAIK PXELinux`
  - Kind: `PXE Linux`

##### Optional templates
- WAIK joinDomain.ps1
  - Name: `WAIK joinDomain.ps1`
  - Kind: `user_data`

- WAIK local users
  - Name: `WAIK local users`
  - Kind: Snippet

__Note:__ This snippet creates extra users in the unattended stage.
This may be very useful for debugging early stages of your deployment; since you
can find yourself locked out of the newly provisioned host.

Microsoft does not really care about password security in unattend.xml files; so it does not really matter if you use
`<PlainText>true</PlainText>` or not. If you prefer the encoded form, you need to append the string `Password` to your user password and encode it to Base64. The following ruby function is an example, it creates the _encoded_ from of `P@55w0rd`:

```
Base64.encode64(Encoding::Converter.new("UTF-8", "UTF-16LE",:undef => nil).convert("P@55w0rd"+"Password")).delete!("\n").chomp
```

- WAIK extraFinishCommands
  - Name: `WAIK extraFinishCommands`
  - Kind: Snippet

__Note:__ The commands here are executed at the last stage just before finishing host building.
Make sure they get executed in a synchronous way (eg. do not run in background like msiexec).
Otherwise the following reboot might kill them.

- WAIK OU from host group
  - Name: `WAIK OU from host group`
  - Kind: Snippet

__Note__: This snippet may be used to generate the computer OU from the host's host group and domain.

_Example_: Given a host `example` in domain `ad.corp.com` and in host group `servers/windows/databases`.
The snippet generates the OU path:
`OU=databases,OU=windows,OU=servers,DC=ad,DC=corp,DC=com`. Optionally, set the host parameter `computerOuSuffix` to add some arbitrary OU at the end.

##### Add installation media
For each of your Windows versions add a new installation medium pointing to the root of the folder containing _boot_ and _sources_
Eg, `http://winmirror.domain.com/pub/win81x64`. Assign them to your operating system.

##### Modify partition table
The default partition table is a simple `diskpart.exe` script. It will wipe `Disk 0`

##### Define templates
Link all the created templates as well as the installation media and partition table to the OS:

1. Head to your OS, then provisioning
2. Select the template from each kind from the drop down list
3. In partition tables, select `WAIK default`
4. In installation media, check the appropriate installation media added above.

##### Add Parameters
To render the the templates correctly, some parameters need to be added. They need to be available as Host Parameter. Most of them make the most sense as parameter on the the OS. Also, almost none are
required and have defaults. For the most up to date desciption see the template itself.

##### Important parameters
1. Required

- `windowsLicenseKey`: Valid Windows license key or generic KMS key
- `windowsLicenseOwner`: Legal owner of the Windows license key
- `wimImageName`: WIM image to install from a multi image install.wim file

__Note:__ The correct value for `wimImageName` depends on your _install.wim_. The provisioning _will fail_ an incorrect value is supplied for a multi image WIM file and gets silently ignored if the image contains one image only. 

2. Optional
The following parameters are only applied if they exist. Some, like `domainJoinAccount` and `domainJoinAccountPasswd` require each other.

- `systemLocale`: en-US
- `systemUILanguage`: en-US
- `systemTimeZone`: Pacific Standard Time - see [MS TimeZone Naming](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms912391%28v=winembedded.11%29.aspx)
- `localAdminAccountDisabled`: false - will keep the local administrator account disabled (default windows)
- `ntpSever`: time.windows.com,other.time.server - ntp server to use
- `domainJoinAccount`: administrator@domain.com - use this account to join the computer to a domain
- `domainJoinAccountPasswd`: Pa55w@rd - Password for the domain join account
- `computerOU`: OU=Computers,CN=domain,CN=com - Place the computer account in specified Organizational Unit
- `computerOuSuffix`: Used if `computerOU` is not present to generate the computer OU from host group and host domain. `computerOU` takes precedence! Note, the OU must still be manually created in active directory
- `computerDomain`: domain.com - domain to join

##### Troubleshooting

* __Templates__

The templates most likely need a lot of testing to work. This is not covered here; though some hints how to start. You should proceed in this order:

1. __Get your templates to render correctly__. Create random `Bare Metal` host in the desired host group for this purpose and make extensive use of [foreman's template preview feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQnaRAI8rf4).
2. __Continue tesing with VMs__ to test netbooting and basic installation
3. __Debug `peSetup.cmd`__ by pausing it at the send (remove the comment from `::PAUSE`). Then, use `Ctrl-C` to cancel the script altogether. This way you can debug the rendered `peSetup.cmd` quite nicely in WinPE (eg, `notepad peSetup.cmd`)
3. 
4. Use a manual installed host to test rendered snippets like `WAIK extraFinishCommands` directly.
5. __Examine `C:\foreman.log.`__ - the output left from the finish script. Also, comment out the clean up stage in the finish script to examine and test the rendered scripts directly.

* __Netbooting__

Sometimes wimboot seems not to be able to boot our winPE.wim. Symptoms range from black screens to kernel panics (aka _BSOD_). These problems seem to be more likely on older hardware.

In this case a workaround can be to simply use any other bootable media like USB thumb drives and CD-ROMs. The process is relatively simple:

1. Use a common tool [Media Creator](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media) to create a bootable medium like a USB stick or ISO image. Since we do not use the image downloaded by the tool, the only importent choice is `architecture`.
2. In the image or the USB drive, replace `sources/boot.wim` with the version from the installation media.
3. Boot from the medium.
