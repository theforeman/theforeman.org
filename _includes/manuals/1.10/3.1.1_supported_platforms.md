The following operating systems are supported by the installer, have packages and are tested for deploying Foreman:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or 7
  * Architectures: x86_64 only
  * [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F) is required
  * Enable the Optional and RHSCL 1 repositories/channels:
    * `yum-config-manager --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms rhel-server-rhscl-6-rpms`
    * check the above repositories because the command can silently fail when subscription does not provide it: `yum repolist`
  * Apply all SELinux-related errata.
* CentOS, Scientific Linux or Oracle Linux 6 or 7
  * Architectures: x86_64 only
  * [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F) is required
* Fedora 19
  * Architectures: x86_64 only
