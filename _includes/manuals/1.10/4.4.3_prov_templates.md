The Provision Templates is the core of Foreman's flexibility to deploy the right OS with the right options. There are several types of template, along with a flexible matching system to deliver different templates to different Hosts.

Foreman comes with pre-created templates for the more common OSs, but you will need to review these.

#### Template Kinds

There are 6 template kinds:

* PXELinux  - Deployed to the TFTP server to ensure the Host boots the correct installer with the correct kernel options
* Provision - The main unattended installation file; e.g. Kickstart or Preseed
* Finish    - A post-install script used to take custom actions after the main provisioning is complete
* user_data - Similar to a Finish script, this can be assigned to hosts built on user_data-capable images (e.g. Openstack, EC2, etc)
* Script    - An arbitrary script, not used by default, useful for certain custom tasks
* iPXE      - Used in {g,i}PXE environments in place of PXELinux

In practice, most environments only make use of the first 3. The *Create Host* action deploys the PXELinux template to the TFTP server. The PXELinux template directs the host to retrieve the Provision template. The Provision template will direct the installer to retrieve and run the Finish template at the end of the install, and the Finish template will notify Foreman the build is complete just before reboot.

##### Editing Templates

Clicking a template will take you to the edit page. All templates are
ERB-enabled, and you can access many variables about the to-be-installed-host
within the template. See [**Template Writing**](http://theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/TemplateWriting) for ideas.

As noted in [**4.1.4 Auditing**](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.1.4Auditing), changes to the templates are logged as diffs - you can browse the history of changes to the templates from the History tab within the Edit Template page. You can also revert changes here.

#### Template Association

When editing a Template, you must assign a list of Operating Systems which this Template can be used with. Optionally, you can restrict a template to a list of Hostgroups and/or Environments

When a Host requests a template (e.g. during provisioning), Foreman will select the best match from the available templates of that type, in the following order:

* Host-group and Environment
* Host-group only
* Environment only
* Operating system default

The final entry, Operating System default, can be set by editing the Operating System page.

##### Associating an Operating System default template

You will need to associate at least one PXELinux, Provision, and Finish template to your Operating System, and this must be done in two steps. First edit each of the templates, switch to the Association tab, and ensure the appropriate OSs are checked. Then edit the Operating System, switch to the Templates tab, and choose a default template for each template kind.

##### Templates Details
For image based installs there are two methods to customize and finish the installation. *Finish templates* and User *Data Templates*:
###### Finish Templates
Finish templates are available for all hypervisors that support image based installs where the foreman server can reach the newly installed machine via ssh and scp. The script generated from the finish template is copied by the Foreman to the newly installed system via scp using username and password specified with the image. It is then executed by connecting again via ssh, making the script executable and either executing it directly or via sudo if the specified user is not root. Standard output and standard error are logged to a file in the same directory named *bootstrap-UUID.log*.

###### User Data Templates
User Data Templates are available for hypervisors that support customization via tools like *cloud-init*. In this case the installed machine does not need be reachable via ssh by the Foreman server but the machine must be able to reach the host via http(s) to notify the Foreman that it finished the setup.
