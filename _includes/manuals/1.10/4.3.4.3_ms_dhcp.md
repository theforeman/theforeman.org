It is required that this procedure is executed as an administrator.

It is not required that the smart-proxy be on the same host as the MS dhcp server. The smart-proxy just needs to be on a windows host that has netsh commands available. If this is the case, make sure the smart proxy service runs as a user with sufficient privileges.

__Note:__ Refer to the [installation guide](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.3.1SmartProxyInstallation) for general setup.

1. Edit config/settings.d/dhcp.yml so that it looks a bit like this. `:dhcp_server:` can be left commented out if smart proxy runs on the same host.

    _Sample config/settings.d/dhcp.yml file_

       ---
       # Can be true, false, or http/https to enable just one of the protocols
       :enabled: true
       # Enable DHCP management
       :dhcp: true
       # The vendor can be either isc or native_ms
       :dhcp_vendor: native_ms
       # The dhcp_server is only used by the native_ms implementation
       :dhcp_server: 10.10.10.1

2. If needed, you have to create the option 60 on the Windows DHCP (for PXE Boot)

    - Open an administrator command prompt
    - Create the PXE Option using netsh

          C:\Windows\system32>netsh
          netsh>dhcp
          netsh dhcp> server 10.10.10.1
          netsh dhcp server>add optiondef 60 PXEClient String 0 comment= PXE Support
