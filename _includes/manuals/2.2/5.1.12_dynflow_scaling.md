Starting with Foreman 2.0 Foreman uses Dynflow backed by Sidekiq by default on all supported platforms. This change is described in greater detail in [Upcoming changes to Dynflow](https://community.theforeman.org/t/upcoming-changes-to-dynflow/14926). The original Dynflow executor service (called `dynflowd`) was replaced by `redis` and a set of `dynflow-sidekiq@*` services. This new deployment model should address issues we have seen when restarting the Dynflow executor. It also allows us scale more easily, dedicate workers to specific queues and increase the overall throughput. The following examples show how to scale Dynflow up in the new model.

### Clean state

Out of the box, foreman ships with orchestrator and a single worker
If you have Katello, you will get an additional worker for processing of the host queue
```
# ls -l /etc/foreman/dynflow/
total 1
-rw-r--r--. 1 root foreman 51 May 14 07:35 orchestrator.yml
-rw-r--r--. 1 root foreman 59 May 14 07:35 worker.yml
```

The orchestrator consumes items only from the `dynflow_orchestrator` queue and has only one thread. This is by design. *Do not change this*
```
# cat /etc/foreman/dynflow/orchestrator.yml
:concurrency: 1
:queues:
  - dynflow_orchestrator
```

The regular worker has 5 threads and consumes items from
default and remote_execution queues. It is not recommended
to change the configuration for this process either, because the changes
would be overwritten by the installer, if run again.

```
# cat /etc/foreman/dynflow/worker.yml
:concurrency: 5
:queues:
  - default
  - remote_execution
```

### Scaling up
Scaling up is pretty straightforward, especially if you want to only scale up what you have
Here we use symbolic links to "share" the actual configuration among `worker`, `worker-1` and `worker-2`
```
# cd /etc/foreman/dynflow
# ln -s worker.yml worker-1.yml
# ln -s worker.yml worker-2.yml
```

Check that the symbolic links are poining to the right files
```
# ls -l /etc/foreman/dynflow/
total 2
-rw-r--r--. 1 root foreman 51 May 14 07:35 orchestrator.yml
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root    10 May 14 11:24 worker-1.yml -> worker.yml
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root    10 May 14 11:24 worker-2.yml -> worker.yml
-rw-r--r--. 1 root foreman 59 May 14 07:35 worker.yml
```

Now start the newly configured services and check their status
```
# systemctl enable --now dynflow-sidekiq@worker-{1,2}

```

### Scaling down
Scaling down is just reverse process, let's say having `worker`, `worker-1` and `worker-2` was
an overkill and we think we would be fine with just `worker` and `worker-1`.
```
# systemctl disable --now dynflow-sidekiq@worker-2
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/dynflow-sidekiq@worker-2.service.

# rm /etc/foreman/dynflow/worker-2.yml
```

### Dedicating a worker to a queue
For this we need to create a new configuration for a worker (or just copy an existing one and change the relevant lines)

Create the configuration file, here we create a worker called `rex` having 5 threads and consuming items from the `remote_execution` queue
```
# cat <<EOF >/etc/foreman/dynflow/rex.yml
:concurrency: 5
:queues:
  - remote_execution
EOF
```

Now let's start the service and check its status
```
# systemctl start dynflow-sidekiq@rex

# systemctl status dynflow-sidekiq@rex

```

### Tuning number of threads per worker
The only thing that needs to be done is changing the number at the `:concurrency:` line and restarting the service.
Either open it up in your favourite `$EDITOR` or do it with `sed`.

Here we can see the worker from previous example has 5 threads. `1785` is the process id taken from previous invocation of systemctl status
```
# ps -fp 1785
foreman     1785       1  0 11:32 ?        00:00:14 sidekiq 5.2.8  [0 of 5 busy]
```

Next we change it to 15
```
# sed -i 's/:concurrency: .*/:concurrency: 15/' /etc/foreman/dynflow/rex.yml
```

Restart the service and check its status
```
# systemctl restart dynflow-sidekiq@rex

# systemctl status dynflow-sidekiq@rex

```

And finally we can check it has more threads.
```
# ps -fp 1903
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD

```
