Updating and creating associations are done in a few different ways in the API
depending on the type of association.

#### One-to-One and One-to-Many

To update a one-to-one or a one-to-many association, simply set the name or id
on the object. For example, to set a host group for a host, simply set the
hostgroup_name or hostgroup_id of the host.

    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
        -d '{ "hostgroup_name": "telerin" }' \
        https://foreman.example.com/api/hosts/celeborn.firstage

    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
        -d '{ "hostgroup_id": 42 }' \
        https://foreman.example.com/api/hosts/celeborn.firstage

#### Many-to-One and Many-to-Many

To update an association for an object that contains a collection of other
objects, there are a few options. First you can set the names or ids:

    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
        -d '{ "host_names": ["enel.first", "celeborni.first", "elwe.first"] }' \
        https://foreman.example.com/api/hostgroups/telerin

    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
        -d '{ "host_ids": [4, 5, 6] }' \
        https://foreman.example.com/api/hostgroups/telerin

This will set the host group's hosts to enel, celeborn, and elwe (or 4, 5, 6)
and only those.

Alternatively, you can pass in a set of objects:

    $ curl -k -u admin:changeme -H "Accept: version=2,application/json" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
        -d '{ "domains": [{ "name": "earendil", "id": 1}, { "name": "turgon", "id": 3 }] }' \
        https://foreman.example.com/api/subnets/iluvatar

This would set the domains for the subnet to be earendil and turgon. If another
domain for example belonged to the subnet before the request, it would be
removed.
