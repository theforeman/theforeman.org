The default API version is v2 for Foreman {{page.version}}, however explicitly requesting the version is recommended.  Both API v1 and v2 are currently shipped.

There are two methods of selecting an API version:

1. In the **header**, pass `Accept: application/json,version=2`

2. In the **URL**, pass /v2/ such as `GET /api/v2/hosts`

Similarly, v1 can still be used by passing `Accept: application/json,version=1` in the header or `api/v1/` in the URL.
