## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### Templates DSL documentation

Foreman now has documentation for DSL used for templates writing. This should
make template writing process easier for non-Rubyists as well as for people who
aren't familiar with all the methods Foreman provides. Documentation is available
locally under `https://<fqdn>/templates_doc`. This documentation will be gradually
enhanced in future releases to cover all available methods and macros.

#### Disabling users

A new option has been added allowing administrators to disable an existing user without deleting them from the system. Disabled users will not be able to log in to Foreman, perform any actions if already logged in, or access the API.

#### API pagination supports 'all'

Foreman API resource listings support pagination. Foreman 2.2 introduces 'all' as a valid value for the `per_page` parameter, which can be used to fetch all records in one request. The returned data structure is unchanged and contains pagination information for a consistent API experience. Care must be taken since some requests might be very expensive but it's a better alternative than specifying a very high number with the same goal.

#### Experimental host details page

Work has been started on creating a new host detail page. The initial implementation can be viewed by enabling the `lab features` setting, and selecting "New Details Page" from the actions drop-down on the hosts index page. Note that this is still very much a work-in-progress and improvements will be added in future releases. If you wish to give feedback on the new implementation or suggestions based on the existing one, please join the [discussion](https://community.theforeman.org/t/host-details-page-redesign-survey/19399) on our community forum.

### Deprecations

### Upgrade warnings

* Trends and statistics are now moved to a separate plugin. See the [manual](/plugins/foreman_statistics) of the new Statistics plugin if you wish continue using them. If not, there will be a rake task provided to clean up any unused entries from the database.
* TFTP integration is now [disabled by default](https://community.theforeman.org/t/disable-foreman-proxy-tftp-support-by-default/18892). Upgrades are unaffected. To enable TFTP integration, `--foreman-proxy-tftp true` must be passed to the installer command.
* The Run Puppet functionality based on puppetrun has been removed. To trigger one-time puppet agent runs, please use the Remote Execution plugin instead. ([More info](https://community.theforeman.org/t/dropping-run-puppet-button-with-a-replacement-using-remote-execution-plugin/12781/25))
* Previously the default installation set the `destroy_vm_on_host_delete` setting to `true`, meaning associated VMs were automatically destroyed upon host deletion in Foreman. This caused a lot of pain for users who did not expect such behavior, and mistakenly destroyed production machines when attempting to remove them from Foreman. The default behavior has been changed and VMs will now remain running on the hypervisor or in the cloud. Notice that this can lead to unexpected payments in case you are paying for these VMs. If you prefer to destroy VMs automatically upon host deletion, switch this setting back to `true`.
* The template helper named `foreman_url` now requires an argument which represents which template kind to render. Previously, no argument was needed to render `provision` template kind. All default templates were updated, for custom templates please rewrite `foreman_url` to `foreman_url('provision')`.
