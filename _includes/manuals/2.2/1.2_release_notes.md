## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### API pagination supports 'all'

Foreman API resource listings support pagination. Foreman 2.2 introduces 'all' as a valid value for the `per_page` parameter, which can be used to fetch all records in one request. The returned data structure is unchanged and contains pagination information for a consistent API experience. Care must be taken since some requests might be very expensive but it's a better alternative than specifying a very high number with the same goal.

#### Templates DSL documentation

Foreman now has documentation for DSL used for templates writing. This should
make template writing process easier for non-Rubyists as well as for people who
aren't familiar with all the methods Foreman provides. Documentation is available
locally under `https://<fqdn>/templates_doc`. This documentation will be gradually
enhanced in future releases to cover all available methods and macros.

### Release Notes

### Deprecations

### Upgrade warnings

* Trends and statistics are now moved to separate plugin. See [manual](/plugins/foreman_statistics) of the new Statistics plugin if you wish continue using it.
* TFTP integration is now [disabled by default](https://community.theforeman.org/t/disable-foreman-proxy-tftp-support-by-default/18892). Upgrades are unaffected. To enable TFTP integration, `--foreman-proxy-tftp true` must be passed to the installer command.
