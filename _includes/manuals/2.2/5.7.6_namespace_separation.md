If clear namespace separation of internally and externally authenticated users is desired, we can distinguish the externally authenticated (and populated) users by having @REALM part in their user names.

For the Kerberos authentication, using `KrbLocalUserMapping Off` will keep the REALM part of the logon name:
{% highlight text %}
# in /etc/httpd/conf.d/auth_kerb.conf
<Location /users/extlogin>
  AuthType Kerberos
  ...
  KrbLocalUserMapping Off
</Location>
{% endhighlight %}

For the PAM authentication, using `InterceptFormLoginRealms EXAMPLE.COM` will make the user's login include this @REALM part (even if the
user did not explicitly specify it), thus matching the username seen by Foreman when authenticated via Kerberos ticket:
{% highlight text %}
# in /etc/httpd/conf.d/intercept_form_submit.conf
<Location /users/login>
  ...
  InterceptFormLoginRealms EXAMPLE.COM
</Location>
{% endhighlight %}

With this configuration, the @REALM will be part of the username and it would be clear that **bob** is INTERNAL-authenticated and **bob@EXAMPLE.COM** is different user, EXTERNAL-authenticated. The admin then can manually create another **admin@EXAMPLE.COM** user (with administrator privileges) and even the admin can use Kerberos or PAM authentication in this setup.
