Please check the [Troubleshooting wiki page](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/1/wiki/Troubleshooting) for solutions to the most common problems.  Otherwise, there are two primary methods of getting support for the Foreman: IRC and discussion forums.

### IRC
We work on the [irc.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/) servers. You can get general support in #theforeman, while development chat takes place in #theforeman-dev.

### Discussion Forums

An online discussion forum is available at https://community.theforeman.org/. Much like IRC, we have discussion areas for general users (support, Q/A, etc), as well as a discussion areas for developers, tutorials and release announcements.

* [General Support](https://community.theforeman.org/c/support)
* [Development](https://community.theforeman.org/c/support)
* [Release Announcements](https://community.theforeman.org/c/release-announcements)

### Gathering information
In order to troubleshoot and get relevant data use foreman-debug which collects information about your OS, Foreman and related components.
If you installed from packages, the command is available to root:

    # foreman-debug

If you installed from git, you can find it in the Foreman directory:

    # script/foreman-debug

If you run it without any options, it will collect data, filter out possible
passwords or tokens and create a tarball which can be safely handed over to
us.

To upload the tarball to our public server via rsync use:

    # foreman-debug -u

This is a write-only directory (readable only by Foreman core developers), please note that the rsync transmission is UNENCRYPTED.
