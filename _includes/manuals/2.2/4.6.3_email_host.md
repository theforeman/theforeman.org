#### Build complete

When a host has completed its build process, either notifying Foreman of completion via a request at the end of its unattended installation or after Foreman has run a script remotely, this email notification will be sent to owners of the host.

#### Puppet error state

When a Puppet report is received that puts the host into a red error state, a corresponding email notification is sent to owners of the host.
