Parameterized class support permits detecting, importing, and supplying parameters direct to classes which support it, via the ENC.  This requires Puppet 2.6.5 or higher.

#### Setup

By default, parameterized class support is enabled in Foreman.  This can be checked from *Administer > Settings > Puppet* and ensure *Parametrized_Classes_in_ENC* is set to *true*.

![Settings](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/settings.png)

Now you'll need to import some parameterized classes from your Puppet server.
If you don't have any parameterized classes in your modules dir, the
foreman-installer has several, you can download a few modules from the Puppet
Forge. Once you have some parameterized modules, import your classes (see
[**4.2.2 Classes**](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.2.2Classes))

#### Configure a class

This example will work with the *foreman* class from the installer. Click on the class, and you should get a page with 3 tabs, like so:

![3 Tabs](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/3tabs.png)

The middle tab, "Smart Class Parameter", is the important one. Click onto that, and you should see something like this:

![Edit](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/1.14/edit.png)

On the left, we have a list of possible parameters that the class supports. On the right, we have the configuration options for the parameter selected.

Lets configure the *foreman* class to change the user the foreman processes run as. Select the *user* parameter, at the end of the list. Now lets go through the options:

* Key
   * This can't be edited, it's just for information
* Description
   * Purely informational textbox for making notes in. Not passed to Puppet, or reused anywhere else
* Puppet Environments
   * This can't be edited, it's just for information
* Override (**important**)
   * If this is unchecked, Foreman will not attempt to control this variable, and it will not be passed to Puppet via the ENC.
* Key type
   * The type of data we want to pass. Most commonly a string, but many other data types are supported. There's no easy way to tell what type of data Puppet is expecting, so you will need to read through the code/documentation that comes with a particular module to find out. Changing the type field requires an appropriately set "Default Value" field.
* Default Value
   * This will be imported from Puppet initially, but if Puppet is using any class inheritance, you'll get something unhelpful like "${$foreman::params::user}". This is because Foreman won't follow the inheritance, so you'll need to set a sensible default value
* Omit
   * Should the parameter be omitted from the ENC provided to puppet by default. This is useful if you want to use the puppet default in most cases, but want to override the value just in certain cases specified by the matchers.
* Hidden value
   * Should the values of the smart class parameter be hidden in the UI.

Ok, so let's configure our *user* parameter. We want to tick Override, set type to "String" and set the default value to "foreman", like so:

![User Param](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/1.14/user_param.png)

<div class="alert alert-info">Tip: you can set Override on all parameters on a class from the Puppet classes list, clicking the dropdown menu on the right and clicking "Override all parameters".</div>

#### Default value

Most importantly, the *Override* option has to be enabled for Foreman to control this variable, otherwise it will never be managed and will not appear in the ENC output.

The *Default value* will be supplied in the ENC output and should be a supported value, such as a string, YAML or JSON structure or use template features (see following sections).  When the *Omit* checkbox is enabled, no default value will be present in the ENC output unless an override matches.  Puppet will instead use the class default or data binding (Hiera) as usual.

The default will be imported from the Puppet manifest initially, but if the class uses an inherited params pattern, it may contain an unhelpful string such as `${$foreman::params::user}`.  Foreman is unable to parse the actual value in this case as it might change when evaluated.  Change the suggested default to the actual value, or tick the *Omit* checkbox.

#### Setting up matchers

We've configured the default, but that's not very useful. We need to be able to override the default for hosts or groups of hosts. To do that we need the "Override Value For Specific Hosts" section at the bottom of the page.

Let's say that any machine in the "development" Puppet environment should use a value of "foremandev" instead of "foreman" for the "user" parameter. Add "environment" to the end of the matchers list, then click the "New Matcher-Value" button, and fill it out like this:

![Matcher](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/1.14/matcher.png)

This is a basic configuration - for more complex examples of using matchers,
see the [Smart Matchers](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.2.6SmartMatchers) section.

#### Overriding a parameter for a host

If Foreman manages the value of a class parameter ("override = true"), it's also possible to update a host-specific override from the host itself. That way you don't have to grant access to the Puppet Classes page to everyone. From a Host, click Edit, go to the Parameters tab, and you'll see the variable, the class-scope, and the current value. You can then override the value for that host:

![Host Edit](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/1.14/hostedit.png)

If the value is hidden you can click the unhide button to temporarily see the value while you edit. Clicking the button won't change the hidden property for the parameter, only show it for editing purpose.

![Hide button](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/1.14/hide_button.png)

If you go back and look at the Puppet class, you'll see Foreman has added a matcher for that host:

![Host Matcher](/static/images/screenshots/param_classes/1.10/hostmatch.png)

The same override button is available on a host group's *Parameters* tab.  For more complex logic, like matching on facts, use the Puppet Class page.

#### Advanced usage

Smart class parameters are based on the smart matchers technology, and have a number of advanced features such as validation and multiple data types. More about these can be found in the [Smart Matchers](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.2.6SmartMatchers) section.
