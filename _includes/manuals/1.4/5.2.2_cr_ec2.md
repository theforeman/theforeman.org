* Ensure AMIs are added under the *Images* tab on the compute resource with the correct username for it to SSH into the image.
* Add a provisioning template of type *finish* which will be executed over SSH on the new image.
* Ensure the finish template is associated to the OS (on the *Associations* tab) and is set as the default for the operating system too.
* Enabling *use_uuid_for_certificates* in *More > Settings* is recommended for consistent Puppet certificate IDs instead of hostnames.
* VPC subnets and security groups can be selected on the *Network* tab when creating a host.
* The *Managed IP* dropdown menu allows selection between using the public and private IP address for communication from Foreman to the instance.

A full example for configuring EC2 provisioning is given on the Foreman blog: [EC2 provisioning using Foreman](http://blog.theforeman.org/2012/05/ec2-provisioning-using-foreman.html).
