## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features

#### Compute profiles

Administrators are now able to define sets of default attributes for new VMs on each compute resource (of any type), and label it as an one-stop "compute profile" for users to create hosts with.

This speeds up host creation and avoids mistakes with complex network and storage options being set by users each time.  Read more about configuring profiles in [Using Compute Profiles](/manuals/1.4/index.html#5.2.2UsingComputeProfiles).

#### Image user data support

Image-based compute resources (EC2, OpenStack Nova) now support supplying a template as user data to the VM instead of Foreman using SSH to configure the newly created host.  In particular, this allows hosts to be created when there is no direct network access from Foreman to the hosts, provided they can contact Foreman.

A new user_data template type has been added and images in Foreman can be configured to resolve a user data template instead of a finish script.  More information in the [EC2](/manuals/1.4/index.html#5.2.3EC2Notes) and [OpenStack documentation](/manuals/1.4/index.html#5.2.6OpenStackNotes).

#### Web UI Kerberos support

Foreman can now be configured under Apache HTTP with mod_auth_kerb to authenticate users using GSSAPI and Kerberos, allowing single sign on (SSO) in enterprise environments.  This has been tested with [FreeIPA project](http://www.freeipa.org) and more information on configuring it can be found in the [SPNEGO documentation](/manuals/1.4/index.html#5.7SPNEGOauthentication).

#### Interface enhancements and plugin support

Foreman 1.4 introduces a new plugin registration system, which allows plugins to extend the menu system, add permissions, roles and other enhancements to the Foreman installation when they're loaded.  Installed plugins are also now visible under *Administer > About*, `foreman-rake plugins` and in the API.

A new "two pane" design has also been added to many index pages around the application, enabling quick creation and editing without waiting for the page to reload entirely.  Full page edits may still be opened in new tabs.

#### A range of new proxy providers

The smart proxy has been updated with new providers for:

* Chef report and fact uploads (details to follow)
* DHCP management with libvirt (dnsmasq)
* DNS record management with libvirt (dnsmasq) and dnscmd (Windows AD)
* Puppet future parser support
* Puppet runs over SSH, SaltStack and with custom commands

### Upgrade notes

The following are major changes to be aware of and check after upgrading.  Upgrade instructions themselves can be found in [3.6 Upgrade](/manuals/1.4/index.html#3.6Upgrade).

#### foreman-mysql replaced with foreman-mysql2

Two MySQL database adapters (mysql and mysql2) were provided in previous versions of Foreman, but the former (foreman-mysql) has now been removed as mysql2 is generally more reliable.

Check /etc/foreman/database.yml before upgrade and ensure any "adapter: mysql" lines are updated to "adapter: mysql2".  The foreman-mysql package should be updated to foreman-mysql2 on upgrade.

#### Software Collections on EL6

Foreman 1.2 and 1.3 provided their own rebuild of the 'ruby193' software collection, which in Foreman 1.4 has been replaced by a dependency on Red Hat Software Collections or a rebuild such as Software Collections for CentOS or Scientific Linux.  This will provide more timely security and bug fix updates, as well as better compatibility with other applications relying on the same SCL.

When upgrading on RHEL6 you should enable the RHSCL repository or channel: `yum-config-manager --enable rhel-server-rhscl-6-rpms` (subscription-manager), or subscribe to `rhel-x86_64-server-6-rhscl-1` if using RHN or Satellite.

On EL6 clones, configure the [CentOS SCL repository](http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/SCL) or the [Scientific Linux SCL repository](http://ftp.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/6.4/x86_64/external_products/softwarecollections/) as appropriate.  On clean installations of 1.4, the appropriate repo will be configured automatically by the installer.

**Important**: After configuring the appropriate repository, run `yum upgrade scl-utils ruby193\*` to ensure the latest available packages are installed.

#### URL tokens now enabled by default

Foreman's per-host token feature for provisioning URLs is now enabled by default, which works in addition to identification by IP and MAC address, helping with complex network setups (including NAT).  Customizations to PXELinux templates to change the URL, e.g. to add `?static=yes` may need updating to form a valid URL, i.e. change to `&static=yes`.

#### New unattended_url setting after upgrade

A new setting has been added which controls the URL used in provisioning templates to refer to the Foreman server. This complements the existing foreman_url setting, which is now used to control the URL for users accessing the Foreman web interface.

Ensure this is correct under *Administer > Settings > Provisioning > unattended_url*, it should refer to the hostname of the Foreman server and is usually HTTP (even if users access Foreman over HTTPS).

### Release notes for 1.4.4

Foreman 1.4.4 is security and bug fix release for Foreman core, and has bug fixes in the Smart Proxy and the SELinux policy.  The installer component will remain at version 1.4.3 (Debian/Ubuntu) or 1.4.2 (RPM).

We recommend that users update to Foreman 1.4.4 as soon as possible due to the security issues that have been fixed in this version.  See the <a href="/security.html">Security advisories</a> page for more information.
