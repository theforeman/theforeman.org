## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features

### Upgrade notes

#### New unattended_url setting

A new setting has been added which controls the URL used in provisioning templates to refer to the Foreman server.  This complements the existing foreman_url setting, which is now used to control the URL for users accessing the Foreman web interface.

Ensure this is correct under *More > Settings > Provisioning > unattended_url*, it should refer to the hostname of the Foreman server and is usually HTTP (even if users access Foreman over HTTPS).

#### foreman-mysql replaced with foreman-mysql2

Two MySQL database adapters (mysql and mysql2) were provided in previous versions of Foreman, but the former (foreman-mysql) has now been removed as mysql2 is generally more reliable.

Check /etc/foreman/database.yml before upgrade and ensure any "adapter: mysql" lines are updated to "adapter: mysql2".  The foreman-mysql package should be updated to foreman-mysql2 on upgrade.

#### User group membership cycles

Previous versions of foreman allowed you to set cycles between groups. It is no longer supported and it would cause errors in 1.4 so before upgrading you must remove all cyclic memberships. A cycle membership (indefinite loop) example is user group A has user group B as a member and user group B has user group A as a member at the same time. Note that cycles can have more levels (e.g. A -> B -> C -> A).
