Foreman can act as a classifier to Puppet through the External Nodes interface. This is a mechanism provided by Puppet to ask for configuration data from an external service, via a script on the puppetmaster.

The external nodes script we supply also deals with uploading facts from hosts to Foreman, so we will discuss the two things together.

#### Configuration

##### puppetmaster

1. Copy [external_node_v2.rb.erb](https://raw.github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman/master/templates/external_node_v2.rb.erb) to the Puppet configuration directory, e.g. '/etc/puppet'
2. The name you choose for the file is arbitrary, but we will assume 'node.rb', e.g. '/etc/puppet/node.rb'. Ensure it is executable by the puppet user.
3. Edit the new file, and configure the settings:
   * url - The address of the Foreman server (e.g. http://foreman )
   * puppetdir - The location of Puppet's cache dir (e.g. /var/lib/puppet )
   * ssl\_\* - SSL certs as per <a href="manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#5.4SecuringCommunicationswithSSL">Securing Communications With SSL</a>
5. Add the following lines to the [master] section of puppet.conf:
   * external_nodes = /etc/puppet/node.rb
   * node_terminus  = exec

Restart the puppetmaster. When the next agent checks in, the puppetmaster will upload
fact data for this host to Foreman, and download the ENC data.

##### Client

No agent configuration is necessary to use this functionality.

##### Testing the config

Make sure that the puppet user can execute the ENC script and it works:

    sudo -u puppet /etc/puppet/node.rb [the name of a node, eg agent.local]

should output something like:

    parameters:
      puppetmaster: puppet
      foreman_env: &id001 production
    classes:
      helloworld:
    environment: *id001

This output should match the information displayed when you click on the YAML button
on the Host page in Foreman.

For further information see the [Puppet Labs docs on external nodes](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/external_nodes.html)

#### Assigning data to hosts through the ENC

Foreman passes all assoicated parameters, classes,and class parameters, to the Host,
including those inherited from host groups, domains, or global settings. See section
<a href="manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.2ManagingPuppet">Managing Puppet</a> for
more information on assigning configuration to hosts.

#### Pushing Facts to Foreman when not using the ENC functionality

There are several options for pushing fact data to Foreman if you are using Foreman
for reporting/inventory only.

##### Using node.rb

The ENC script (node.rb) accepts an option to run in 'batch-mode'. In this mode,
the script iterates over the cached fact data stored on the puppet master, and uploads
all of it to Foreman.

Download and configure the node.rb script as above, and then call it like this:

    sudo -u puppet /etc/puppet/node.rb --push-facts

##### Direct HTTP upload

As of Foreman 1.3, the fact-upload API endpoint accepts data in pure JSON. You can
push data to Foreman as a hash containing:

    {
      "name": "fqdn-of-host.domain.com",
      "certname": "optional-certname-of-host.domain.com",
      "facts": {
        "fact1": "string",
        "fact2": "true",
        "fact3": "1.2.3.4",
        ...
      }
    }

The 'certname' is optional but will be used to location the Host in Foreman if
supplied. The 'facts' hash must be a flat hash, not nested with other arrays or hashes.
See _link-to-API-when-its-updated-here_ for more details.

This body can be POSTed to '/api/hosts/facts' using Foreman API v2. See the
[node.rb template](https://raw.github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman/master/templates/external_node_v2.rb.erb) for an example of constructing and sending data in Ruby.
