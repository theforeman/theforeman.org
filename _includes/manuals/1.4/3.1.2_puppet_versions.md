#### Facter compatibility

Foreman is known to be compatible with all Facter 1.x releases.

The Foreman installer has an incompatibility with Facter 2.x, fixed in Foreman 1.4.2 via [#4372](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/4372).

Compatibility with structured facts in Facter 2.x is being introduced via [#4528](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/4528).
