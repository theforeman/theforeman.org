* Requires client e-mail address and p12 certificate file to access
* Ensure images are associated under the *Images* tab on the compute resource.
* Add a provisioning template of type *finish* which will be executed over SSH on the new image.
* Ensure the finish template is associated to the OS (on the *Associations* tab) and is set as the default for the operating system too.
* Enabling *use_uuid_for_certificates* in *Administer > Settings* is recommended for consistent Puppet certificate IDs instead of hostnames.
* The *External IP* checkbox means the public IP address (rather than private IP) will be used for communication with the instance from Foreman.
