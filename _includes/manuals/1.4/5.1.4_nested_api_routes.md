Nested routes exist for all associated objects (`has_many`).

All actions are accessible in nested routes.

An example of a nested route would be `GET /api/domains/5/subnets`. In this case, `/api/domains/5/subnets` would give the `subnets` associated with the `domain` that had an `id=5`, whereas `GET /api/subnets` would return all `subnets`.
