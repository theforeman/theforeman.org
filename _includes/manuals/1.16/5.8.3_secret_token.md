The last file required to make a Foreman cluster work is `$app_root/config/initializers/local_secret_token.rb`, which is used to sign cookies. This should be set the same across all Foreman servers in your cluster. Once you have set `local_secret_token.rb`, restart Foreman and clear Foreman's cache:
{% highlight bash %}
touch ~foreman/tmp/restart.txt
foreman-rake tmp:cache:clear
foreman-rake tmp:sessions:clear
{% endhighlight %}
