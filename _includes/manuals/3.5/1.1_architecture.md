## Foreman Architecture

A Foreman installation will always contain a central Foreman instance
that is responsible for providing the Web based GUI, node
configurations, initial host configuration files, etc. However, if the
Foreman installation supports unattended installations, then other
operations need to be performed to fully automate this process. The
Smart Proxy manages remote services and is generally installed with all
Foreman installations to manage TFTP, DHCP, DNS, Puppet, Puppet CA,
Ansible, and Salt.

## Smart-Proxy

A [Smart-Proxy](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.3SmartProxies) is located on or near a machine that performs a specific function and helps Foreman orchestrate the process of commissioning a new host. Placing the Smart Proxy on or near to the actual service will also help reduce latency in large distributed organizations.
