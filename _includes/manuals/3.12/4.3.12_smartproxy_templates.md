In this chapter, we will describe how to setup a Smart Proxy to serve
provisioning templates.

The smart proxy is able to proxy template requests from hosts in isolated
networks to the Foreman server, when the proxy also handles TFTP.

This feature relies on correctly [configured trusted_proxies]({{ site.baseurl }}manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.5.2ConfigurationOptions) on Foreman.

<div class="alert alert-info">Generally, you want the templates to be available on HTTP as well as HTTPS.  When enabling HTTP on your smart proxy, ensure that other modules' configurations in /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/*.yml are secure by setting :enabled: to https instead of true.</div>

Ensure the foreman_url in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yaml` points to your Foreman instance, and that your smart proxy is listening on HTTP by uncommenting `http_port`. Now
configure `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/templates.yml`:

```yaml
:enabled: true
:template_url: http://smart-proxy.example.com:8000
```

Once you've completed the above steps, restart the foreman-proxy service and refresh the features on your Foreman server.

The templates feature is used automatically: any host that uses this proxy for TFTP will also use the proxy to retrieve its templates.
