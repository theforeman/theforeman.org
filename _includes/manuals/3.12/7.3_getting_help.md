### Gathering information
In order to troubleshoot and get relevant data use foreman-debug which collects information about your OS, Foreman and related components.
If you installed from packages, the command is available to root:

    # foreman-debug

If you installed from git, you can find it in the Foreman directory:

    # script/foreman-debug

If you run it without any options, it will collect data, filter out possible
passwords or tokens and create a tarball which can be safely handed over to
us.

To upload the tarball to our public server via rsync use:

    # foreman-debug -u

This is a write-only directory (readable only by Foreman core developers), please note that the rsync transmission is UNENCRYPTED.
