Foreman is a rails application. Therefore, anything that is supported under RAILS (sqlite, mysql, postgresql, ...) can be used. See <a href="manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.3InstallFromPackages">3.3 Install From Packages</a> for a list of packages for connecting foreman to the databse of your choice. At this time, Oracle DB is known to not work. Patches are welcome!

The database configuration file can be found at:

<pre>/etc/foreman/database.yml</pre>

#### SQLite (default)

<div class="alert alert-info">When using SQLite, you can install the
foreman-sqlite package. See <a href="manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.3InstallFromPackages">3.3 Install From Packages</a>.</div>

By default, the database will be created in the db subdirectory.

{% highlight ruby %}
production:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/production.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000
{% endhighlight %}

#### MySQL

<div class="alert alert-info">When using MySQL, you can install the
foreman-mysql2 package. See <a href="manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.3InstallFromPackages">3.3 Install From Packages</a>.</div>

Edit your config/database.yml and modify:
{% highlight ruby %}
production:
  adapter: mysql2
  database: foreman
  username: foreman
  password: password
  host: localhost
  socket: "/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock"
{% endhighlight %}

Prior to version 1.4, the foreman-mysql package was available, however support
of this and the legacy 'mysql' adapter has been discontinued.

Afterwards you would need to re-populate your database, simply execute:

    foreman-rake db:migrate
    foreman-rake db:seed

#### PostgreSQL

<div class="alert alert-info">When using PostgreSQL, you can install the
foreman-postgresql package. See <a href="manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.3InstallFromPackages">3.3 Install From Packages</a>.</div>

Edit your config/database.yml and modify:
{% highlight ruby %}
production:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: foreman
  username: foreman
  password: password
  host: localhost
{% endhighlight %}

#### Switching from SQLite to MySQL/PostgreSQL while maintaining existing data

We have a rake task for this. First setup your database.yml to have the sqlite db as production and the mysql/psql db as dev:

{% highlight ruby %}
production:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/production.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

development:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: foreman
  username: foreman
  password: password
  host: localhost
{% endhighlight %}

Now migrate both dbs so they're consistent:

{% highlight ruby %}
bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
{% endhighlight %}

Now move the data to the new db
{% highlight ruby %}
bundle exec rake db:convert:prod2dev
{% endhighlight %}

(On RPM distros, remove "bundle exec" from the start of these commands.)

Once you've migrated to your new database using prod2dev, you should update your database.yml file to point your 'production' environment at the new database.
You should also update the 'development' environment to point to an alternative location (for example, at SQLite) to ensure you don't accidentally overwrite your production database.

##### Special notes for migrating to Postgres

Firstly, the default installer setup doesn't give superuser privileges to the 'foreman' user, which then prevents the prod2dev script from temporarily disabling foreign keys. You'll need to do

{% highlight bash %}
sudo -u postgres psql -c 'ALTER USER foreman WITH SUPERUSER'
{% endhighlight %}

before the prod2dev call, and

{% highlight bash %}
sudo -u postgres psql -c 'ALTER USER foreman WITH NOSUPERUSER'
{% endhighlight %}

after it.

Secondly, the psql sequence numbers will be wrong after the prod2dev execution. You can fix them like this:

{% highlight bash %}
cat <<EOF > reset.sql
SELECT  'SELECT SETVAL(' ||quote_literal(S.relname)|| ', MAX(' ||quote_ident(C.attname)|| ') ) FROM ' ||quote_ident(T.relname)|| ';'
FROM pg_class AS S, pg_depend AS D, pg_class AS T, pg_attribute AS C
WHERE S.relkind = 'S'
    AND S.oid = D.objid
    AND D.refobjid = T.oid
    AND D.refobjid = C.attrelid
    AND D.refobjsubid = C.attnum
ORDER BY S.relname;
EOF
psql -Atq -f reset.sql -o temp foreman
psql -f temp foreman
rm temp reset.sql
{% endhighlight %}
