The FreeIPA implementation of the realm proxy is able to add a host entry to FreeIPA, send the hostgroup name, and request a one-time registration password.

##### Configuration of FreeIPA

Your Smart Proxy should be registered to the FreeIPA realm already.  You'll also need to create a special role for the Smart Proxy
with the minimum sets of permissions. A [script](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/IPASmartProxyUser) is available in the wiki to create the user automatically, or you can create it manually with the steps below.

From a machine with ipa-admintools:

 1. Obtain Kerberos Credentials

        kinit admin

 2. Create a new privilege 

        ipa privilege-add 'Smart Proxy Host Management' --desc='Smart Proxy Host Management'

 3. Create the permissions needed to update one-time passwords and the userclass:

        ipa permission-add 'modify host password' --permissions='write' --type='host' --attrs='userpassword'
        ipa permission-add 'write host certificate' --permissions='write' --type='host' --attrs='usercertificate'
        ipa permission-add 'modify host userclass' --permissions='write' --type='host' --attrs='userclass'

 4. Add the permissions to the privilege:

        ipa privilege-add-permission 'Smart Proxy Host Management' --permission='add hosts' \
         --permission='remove hosts' --permission='modify host password' --permission='modify host userclass' \
         --permission='modify hosts' --permission='revoke certificate' --permission='manage host keytab' \
         --permission='write host certificate' --permissions='retrieve certificates from the ca' \
         --permissions='modify services' --permissions='manage service keytab' \
         --permission='read dns entries' --permission='remove dns entries' \
         --permission='add dns entries' --permission='update dns entries' 

 5. Create a new role:

        ipa role-add 'Smart Proxy Host Manager' --desc='Smart Proxy management'

 6. Assign the privilege to the role:

        ipa role-add-privilege 'Smart Proxy Host Manager' --privilege='Smart Proxy Host Management'

 7. Create a user in FreeIPA for the proxy to use, such as `realm-proxy`.  Don't use foreman-proxy or foreman as the username! 

        ipa user-add realm-proxy --first Smart --last Proxy

 8. Assign the above created role:

        ipa role-add-member 'Smart Proxy Host Manager' --users=realm-proxy

 9. Get the Keytab for the Realm Proxy User

        ipa-getkeytab -s <ipa server> -p realm-proxy@EXAMPLE.COM -k freeipa.keytab

##### Configuration of Smart Proxy

The Smart Proxy machine needs to be at a minimum registered to FreeIPA and running on RHEL,
a clone such as CentOS, or Fedora.

Copy the freeipa.keytab created in step 9 above to /etc/foreman-proxy/freeipa.keytab and set
the correct permissions:

        chown foreman-proxy /etc/foreman-proxy/freeipa.keytab
        chmod 600 /etc/foreman-proxy/freeipa.keytab

Enable the realm proxy in `config/settings.yaml`:

    :realm: true

Set the realm provider to freeipa:

    :realm_provider: freeipa

Provide the location of the keytab and the principal (user) you're using:

    :realm_keytab: /etc/foreman-proxy/freeipa.keytab
    :realm_principal: realm-proxy@EXAMPLE.COM

If you're using FreeIPA to manage DNS records, and want them to be 
automatically deleted when the host is deleted in Foreman, set this
to true:

    :freeipa_remove_dns: true

Finally, trust the IPA Certificate Authority. Ensure you have the most up-to-date version of the 'ca-certificates' package installed.

    cp /etc/ipa/ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ipa.crt
    update-ca-trust enable
    update-ca-trust

You will need to disable the DNS proxy for hosts that are provisioned with a Realm set, as Free IPA adds the forward record for you. In order to support adding a reverse lookup record also, you will need to go into the settings for the forward lookup zone on the IPA server and tick the Allow PTR sync option. This will make sure that Free IPA creates the PTR records for you

##### Using Automember Rules

FreeIPA supports the ability to setup automember rules based on attributes of a system.  When using the FreeIPA proxy, the Foreman host group is available as a parameter in FreeIPA known as `userclass`.  Nested host groups are sent as displayed in the Foreman UI, e.g. "Parent/Child/Child".  Note that Foreman does send updates to FreeIPA, however automember rules are only applied at initial add.  This will be coming in a [future version of FreeIPA](https://fedorahosted.org/freeipa/ticket/3752).

First, we create a host group in FreeIPA:

    # ipa hostgroup-add webservers
    Description: web servers
    ----------------------------
    Added hostgroup "webservers" 
    ----------------------------
      Host-group: webservers
      Description: web servers

Define an automember rule:

    # ipa automember-add --type=hostgroup webservers
    ----------------------------------
    Added automember rule "webservers" 
    ----------------------------------
    Automember Rule: webservers

Create an automember condition based on the `userclass` attribute:

    # ipa automember-add-condition --key=userclass --type=hostgroup --inclusive-regex=^webserver webservers
    ----------------------------------
    Added condition(s) to "webservers" 
    ----------------------------------
      Automember Rule: webservers
      Inclusive Regex: userclass=^webserver
    ----------------------------
    Number of conditions added 1
    ----------------------------

When a machine in Foreman is in the "webservers" host group, it will automatically be added to the FreeIPA
"webservers" host group as well.  FreeIPA host groups allow for Host-based access controls (HBAC), sudo policies,
etc.
