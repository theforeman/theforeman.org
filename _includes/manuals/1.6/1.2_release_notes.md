## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features

#### Smart Proxy plugin support

The Smart Proxy has followed Foreman itself in getting support for plugins, enabling developers to write new APIs and integrate it with other types of systems.  The [first plugin](https://github.com/theforeman/smart-proxy-pulp) reports the status of [Pulp](http://pulpproject.org) over an API.

Future plugins will likely be paired with Foreman plugins, enabling management of other services or extending provisioning models (e.g. discovery).  Existing proxy functionality may be split out in later versions, enabling faster development and better dependency management via packaging.

For existing proxy users, the most notable change is in configuration, which has been split from a single settings.yml file into a directory at /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/.  During package upgrades, existing config files will be migrated to the new layout.  Reference information is in the updated [Smart Proxy Settings](/manuals/1.6/index.html#4.3.2SmartProxySettings) chapter.

#### API version 2 is stable

API version 2 (aka APIv2) is now declared stable and is recommended for use instead of version 1.  This version is largely similar, but adds a lot of routes for managing nested resources such as Puppet class parameters, network interfaces and compute profiles.  Future releases of Foreman will avoid incompatible changes in the format of the API, however sometimes the meaning and presence of attributes may change.

Notable general features about the API format are:

* Lists of resources are enclosed in a 'results' node, alongside metadata such as the number of entries
* References to other resources may use names or IDs, e.g. "domain_id" / "domain_name", or "domain_ids" / "domain_names"
* Deeper nesting of resources, e.g. /api/v2/puppetclasses/example::class/smart_class_parameters/example_parameter/override_values

The [API chapter](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#5.1API) has more information about accessing the API and the layout of requests and responses.  Also see the [APIv2 reference documentation](/api_v2.html) available on our website, or via your own Foreman installation by appending `/apidoc` to the URL to see the API routes available.

#### External user groups for LDAP and Kerberos group support

User groups in Foreman are now able to be linked to an "external" group in an authentication source - either LDAP, including POSIX, FreeIPA and Active Directory, or via SSSD (see [section 5.7](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#5.7.4Populateusersandattributes)).

As roles can be assigned to user groups, this enables new users to log in and automatically receive permissions in Foreman via their assigned groups in LDAP etc.

#### Support for RHEL 7

Foreman 1.6 adds full support for RHEL 7, from installation through to the web UI and proxy services.  This relies on Red Hat Software Collections 1.1 (RHSCL) in the same way as EL6 support.  Packages are available in the same repositories under 'el7'.

Please note that rebuilds (CentOS, Scientific Linux) of RHEL 7 are not yet supported as SCL 1.1 is unavailable.  As soon as this issue has been resolved, documentation will be updated.

#### Configurable and extensible dashboard

The dashboard shown after logging in has been revamped to allow plugins to add their own widgets, showing relevant information about other aspects of Foreman to users.

It also allows users to drag and drop the widgets around and to remove widgets that aren't of interest, then to save or revert customizations from the dropdown menu.

#### Puppet directory environment support

Puppet 3.6's [directory environments feature](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/environments.html) allows simple and reliable configuration of environments under /etc/puppet/environments, a layout that Foreman installer users will be familiar with.

From Foreman 1.6, the installer configures the same layout using directory environments and the Smart Proxy is able to import Puppet modules laid out in this way (also available in 1.5.2).

### Deprecation warnings

#### Last release for Debian 6.X (Squeeze)

Due to Squeeze's advancing age, troubles with building packages, and the small number of downloads from deb.theforeman.org, the decision has been taken that 1.6 will be the last major release for Debian Squeeze. Minor releases of the 1.6 series will continue to be build for Squeeze, but users are encouraged to upgrade.

The prior debate over this can be viewed on the Google Groups [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/foreman-users/squeeze/foreman-users/m2qMGKvPFro/lZ7sPjxzfcEJ).

#### Ruby 1.8.7 support in Foreman core

The core Foreman application will likely drop support for running under Ruby 1.8.7 in the next major release or two ([mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foreman-dev/p48T8bQ21hY), [#4656](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/4656)).  Please note that this does not affect the Smart Proxy, installer or Hammer CLI.

This may affect users running Foreman from source, who are recommended to seek a newer Ruby interpreter (1.9.3 or 2.0.0), either from packages (SCLs, PPAs etc) or a tool such as [RVM](http://rvm.io).

EL users are unaffected due to Software Collections providing newer versions, and Debian 7 (Wheezy), Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) or Fedora 19 users are unaffected as Ruby 1.9.3 is used.  Debian 6 (Squeeze) users are referred to the previous notice, and support for Ubuntu 12.04 is aimed to continue via [#7227](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/7227).
