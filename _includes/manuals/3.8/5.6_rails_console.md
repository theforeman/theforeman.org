Foreman is a Ruby on Rails application, which provides an interactive console for advanced debugging and troubleshooting tasks.  Using this allows easy bypass of authorization and security mechanisms, and can easily lead to loss of data or corruption unless care is taken.

To access the Rails console, choose the method below appropriate to the installation method.

##### RPM and Debian installations

As root, execute:

{% highlight bash %}
yum install foreman-console
foreman-rake console
{% endhighlight %}

or to run in sandboxed mode, which rolls back changes on exit, execute:

{% highlight bash %}
foreman-rake console -- --sandbox
{% endhighlight %}

##### Source installations

As the user running Foreman and in the source directory, execute:

{% highlight bash %}
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails c
{% endhighlight %}

or to run in sandboxed mode, which rolls back changes on exit, execute:

{% highlight bash %}
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails c --sandbox
{% endhighlight %}

##### Set up

To assume full admin permissions in order to modify objects, enter in the console:

{% highlight ruby %}
User.current = User.only_admin.visible.first
{% endhighlight %}
