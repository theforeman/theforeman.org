The following operating systems are supported by the installer, have packages and are tested for deploying Foreman:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
  * Architectures: x86_64 only
  * [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F) is required
  * Enable the Optional repository/channel:
    * `yum-config-manager --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms`
    * check the above repositories because the command can silently fail when subscription does not provide it: `yum repolist`
  * Apply all SELinux-related errata.
* CentOS, Scientific Linux or Oracle Linux 7
  * Architectures: x86_64 only
  * [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F) is required
* Fedora 24
  * Architectures: x86_64 only
* Debian 8 (Jessie)
  * Architectures: i386, amd64, armhf

It is recommended to apply all OS updates if possible.

All platforms will require Puppet 3 or higher, which may be installed from OS or the Puppet Labs repositories.
