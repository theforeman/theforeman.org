Foreman is also able to send out a variety of email notifications either on an event, or summary messages on a regular schedule.  Plugins are also able to extend this with their own summaries and notifications.

To send email requires a configured SMTP server or local MTA (e.g. sendmail), which is set up in `Adminster > Settings > Email` as per [Configuration Options](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.5.2ConfigurationOptions).

Scheduled emails are sent through rake tasks (reports:daily, reports:weekly, reports:monthly) run from cronjobs, which are configured in `/etc/cron.d/foreman`.
