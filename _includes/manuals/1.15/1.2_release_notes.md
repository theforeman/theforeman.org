## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features

#### Default owner for new hosts

A new setting "Host Owner" (under Administer > Settings) allows to set an default owner for newly provisioned hosts. The default owner can be a user or an user group, and the feature can be disabled if it is not needed.

#### Introduced notification drawer

With all the information Foreman has about infrastructure, the new notifications system is meant to help you get that information proactively. The notifications drawer can warn you about important events happening in Foreman, and proactively help to resolve any operational issues. This version contains a preliminary version with limited notifications, which are expected to grow in number in future releases.

#### Template locking
In order to avoid unexpected changes in your templates, now you can lock them. This means only people with permission to unlock templates can modify them, other users would have to clone them. The templates shipped with Foreman via [community-templates](https://github.com/theforeman/community-templates) will make use of this feature from this release on. This means the templates that come from Foreman will come locked and will be updated automatically in every release. If you want to modify the default templates, it is recommended to clone them and make your own custom templates.

#### CSV export of tables

An effort to export the tables you see in the UI to CSV has begun. For this release, the tables for fact values, hosts and reports can be exported to CSV and read by anything that supports this format.

#### Import hosts from compute resource

A long-wanted feature, now it is possible to just add a connection to a Compute Resource (EC2, Rackspace, VMWare...) and import any or all your hosts to Foreman.

#### SSH keys deployed per user

1.15 facilitates logging to your newly created hosts through SSH by automatically adding the SSH keys from the user or user group that creates the host. These keys are also available to be used in templates and as part of the ENC data.

* [CVE-2016-8634](security.html#CVE-2016-8634:organizations/locationswizardmayrunstoredXSSinname) is fixed on this version. This means users not in any organization or location will not be able to see anything unless they are administrators.
* Roles 'Manager' and 'Viewer' used to only have permissions related to Foreman itself but no permissions related to Foreman plugins. This decision was taken because users found confusing that "Viewer" or "Manager" roles would not contain all permissions.

### Deprecations

#### Last release with Puppet 3.x support in installer
1.15 is the last release with Puppet 3 support in foreman-installer.
For Puppet 3 users looking to upgrade, the [Upgrading from Puppet 3 to 4](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Upgrading_from_Puppet_3_to_4) page on the wiki contains guidance.

#### Last release for Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)
Due to Trusty's advancing age and the fact it's bringing Ruby 2.0, 1.15 will be the last major release for Ubuntu/trusty. Minor releases of the 1.15 series will continue to be built for Trusty, but users are encouraged to upgrade.

#### Deprecated internal methods
The following deprecations were introduced during this release and will remain deprecated until version 1.17 when they will be retired.

* `Host::Managed#to_ip_address` - use `NicIpResolver.new(:nic => provision_interface).to_ip_address(name_or_ip)`. This allows to resolve IPs at the interface level and does not require a Host to exist.
* `audit_modified?` in seeds.rb is now replaced by `SeedHelper.audit_modified?`. The SeedHelper class now contains tests for this. Behavior is identical. The internals of the method are different but external behavior remains the same.
