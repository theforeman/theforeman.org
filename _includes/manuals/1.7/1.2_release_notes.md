### Headline features

#### Smart class parameters

##### Deep merging of hash and array values

</a>

Smart class parameters and variables have an order field that states the order in which matches are resolved, from most to least specific, e.g. FQDN, host group, OS and domain.  When the first match is reached, the value is usually returned.

A new *Merge overrides* option has been added to hash and array parameters that combines the returned value from any successful matcher, so it can return an array or hash of values from every level.  This is a "deep" merge, so nested hashes will be merged too.  Array parameters have an additional *Avoid duplicates* option which removes any duplicate values from the value after merging.

An example usage would be a hash of users, which may be defined en masse at the domain level, but specific host groups or hosts may add additional users which are merged into the same hash.  Deep merging may also allow a host to override a single property, such as `{"example":{"ensure": "absent"}}`.

##### Use Puppet default value

When configuring a smart class parameter or variable, a default value has always been required, and when overriding for a host or other matcher, a value must also be specified.

A new *Use Puppet default* checkbox on the default value and individual matchers now ensures the parameter is removed from the ENC output, so the default value specified in the manifest or via data binding (Hiera) is used instead.

##### Easy mass-overrides

<div id="modalSCParamOverrides" class="modal modal-youtube hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="modalSCParamOverridesLabel" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="modal-body">
    <iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/k5IesciIhbw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
  <div class="modal-footer">
    <button class="btn" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">Close</button>
  </div>
</div>
<a class="pull-right" href="#modalSCParamOverrides" data-toggle="modal">
  <img src="/static/images/youtube_icon_play.png" width="48" height="34" title="Play override all smart class parameters video" />
</a>

New buttons have been added to the Puppet class list to quickly override all smart class parameters, or reset them to default values in a single click.  This is accessible from the dropdown menu to the right of each class.  Click the YouTube icon for a short demonstration.

#### Host creation: Build review page

<div id="modalBuildReview" class="modal modal-youtube hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="modalBuildReview" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="modal-body">
    <iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/u2T96Ekpysg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
  <div class="modal-footer">
    <button class="btn" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">Close</button>
  </div>
</div>
<a class="pull-right" href="#modalBuildReview" data-toggle="modal">
  <img src="/static/images/youtube_icon_play.png" width="48" height="34" title="Play build review page video" />
</a>

The host build process is a complex set of steps, which can have many failure points.  A new build review page has been added to the Build button, allowing you to quickly check that templates render correctly, that smart proxies are accessible, and to use the built-in power management feature to optionally reboot the host too.  Click the YouTube icon for a short demonstration.

#### Network configuration: Virtual and bond device support

Foreman now supports a number of more complex network interface types that can be added to hosts, including aliased addresses, VLANs and bonds.  These are usually configured under the Network tab when creating or editing a host, and can now be populated automatically using facts (control with `ignore_puppet_facts_for_provisioning` in *Administer > Settings*).

Advanced provisioning templates can now take advantage of this extra data, even configuring bonds and other devices at build-time ready for first boot (see [community-templates](https://github.com/theforeman/community-templates)).

Networking information has also been added to Foreman's ENC (External Node Classifier) output under the "subnets" and "interfaces" parameters, allowing network configuration to be applied and enforced from Puppet.

#### APIv2: Additional nested URLs to filter resources

New routes (URLs) have been added to APIv2 that show sets of resources that are associated to another, e.g. domains associated with a subnet, or installation media associated to an operating system.  More details on these can be found in the API documentation, look for routes such as `/operatingsystems/:operatingsystem_id/media`.

### Deprecation warnings

#### No support for Debian 6 (Squeeze)

Due to Squeeze's advancing age, troubles with building packages, and the small number of downloads from deb.theforeman.org, Foreman 1.7 is no longer supported on Debian 6 (Squeeze).  Users are recommended to upgrade to Debian 7 (Wheezy) when moving to Foreman 1.7.

The prior debate over this can be viewed on the Google Groups [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/foreman-users/squeeze/foreman-users/m2qMGKvPFro/lZ7sPjxzfcEJ).

#### No support for Ruby 1.8.7 in Foreman core

The core Foreman application will no longer run under Ruby 1.8.7, instead requiring Ruby 1.9.3 or 2.0.0.  Please note that this does not affect the Smart Proxy, installer or Hammer CLI.

All [supported operating systems](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.1.1SupportedPlatforms) will continue to work as they use newer versions of Ruby to run Foreman, but this may affect users who run Foreman from source.  Ubuntu 12.04 had some significant packaging changes to support this by moving to the Brightbox Ruby NG PPA, so please be sure to read the [upgrade guide](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.6Upgrade).

#### Rundeck output support moved to a plugin

Foreman had an API endpoint to output a list of hosts and metadata for [Rundeck](http://rundeck.org/) to consume, which has now been moved to its own plugin for ease of maintenance.  [Install the plugin](/manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#6.Plugins) if you need Rundeck support:

* RPM users: yum install ruby193-rubygem-foreman_host_rundeck
* Debian or Ubuntu users: apt-get install ruby-foreman-host-rundeck
* Source or gem users: install foreman_host_rundeck

#### LDAP authentication with $login

When authenticating users with LDAP, Foreman can use the user's own login and password to bind to the LDAP server to retrieve information.  Foreman 1.6 introduced support for mapping LDAP groups to Foreman user groups, and so a dedicated service account is now recommended to use this new feature.

If the account listed in the LDAP server config (in *Adminster > LDAP authentication*) uses $login in the username, this should be changed to a dedicated account with bind, read and search permissions in the directory.  Future versions of Foreman may remove support for $login.
