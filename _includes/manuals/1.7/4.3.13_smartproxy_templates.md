The templates module requires HTTP to be enabled. It is reccomended to configure all other modules to exclusively listen on HTTPS by changing <code>:enabled:</code> to <code>https</code> in their respective configurations.
</div>

Activate the templates module within the Smart Proxy instance.  This module proxies provisioning templates through the Smart Proxy, so that a host does not need to talk to Foreman directly.
If the TFTP proxy for a host has the templates module enabled, the host will use it for all Foreman URL's (provisioning, built, etc).

The host to proxy connection requires the Smart Proxy to listen on an HTTP port.
