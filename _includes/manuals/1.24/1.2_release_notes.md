## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features
#### Support for Azure Resource Manager Compute Resource
Foreman can now provision hosts using Azure Resource Manager (AzureRM) as a Compute Resource via the `foreman_azure_rm` plugin. Provisioning can be successfully done on Linux platforms with either Finish template or Userdata template. Currently, it supports single OS disk for the VM and uses public images provided by Azure Marketplace.

#### Single Sign-On (SSO) support using OpenID-Connect
Foreman is now capable of performing Single Sign-On with the help of various OpenID Providers, such as Keycloak or Auth0, using the OIDC protocol. With the help of OpenID Providers, organizations can incorporate multiple authorization sources such as User Federations (LDAP or Kerberos), Social (such as GitHub, Twitter and others) and will be able to perform two-factor authentication (using OTP, smart card or code generation). The SSO feature enables an `External` user to login into Foreman using an OpenID Provider.

#### Debian 10 (Buster) support
Packages for Foreman and its various plug-ins are now being built for Debian 10 (Buster) as well. The next Foreman release will drop support for Debian 9 (Stretch) and users are encouraged to upgrade.

#### Dynflow deployment with Sidekiq
Foreman is now able to use Dynflow deployed with Sidekiq, as described in [Upcoming changes to Dynflow](https://community.theforeman.org/t/upcoming-changes-to-dynflow/14926). This new deployment model should address issues we have seen when restarting the Dynflow executor. This is currently included as a preview and can be enabled by hand, if desired.

On Debian based platforms this feature is not packaged yet, but it is planned for the near future.

To enable it on EL7 and derivatives:

```
# Install and enable redis
yum install -y redis
systemctl enable --now redis

# Install new Dynflow service files
yum install -y foreman-dynflow-sidekiq

# Disable old Dynflow deployment, the old and new can run at once, but it isn't advised
systemctl disable --now dynflowd

# Enable the new dynflow services
systemctl enable --now dynflow-sidekiq@{orchestrator,worker}
```

#### Cockpit single sign-on

Cockpit single sign-on via "Web Console" button. For more information how to set it up, head over to [Remote Execution](/plugins/foreman_remote_execution/1.7/index.html#3.6CockpitIntegration) manual.

### Deprecations

* This is the last release supporting Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) and Debian Stretch (9). Users should upgrade their base OS while on this release.
* Support for MySQL and SQLite will be dropped in the next release. Users should migrate their databases to PostgreSQL while on this release. [Further details](https://theforeman.org/2019/09/dropping-support-for-mysql.html)
* Smart Variables are deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Users should use Smart Class Parameters or Global Parameters instead. [Further details](https://community.theforeman.org/t/dropping-smart-variables/16176)

### Upgrade warnings

* The DNS conflict timeout setting (found under Provisioning) has been changed from an integer to an array of values (separated by comma). It's also renamed to `DNS timeout`. It used to represent timeout (in seconds) for DNS lookup attempts such as the dns_lookup macro and DNS record conflict validations. Multiple values in the array now represent multiple attempts to resolve name over DNS with the default value of [5, 10, 15, 20]. If this value was modified however, the upgrade process will keep the single value. This means there's no retry. Users who've changed this value should review the new value.
* Foreman no longer imports all facts, structured facts (e.g. `networking::interface`) and selected root facts (identified by hardcoded list - see below) are imported up to 100 elements. If a host reports more, they will be dropped and fact named `foreman::dropped_subtree_facts` will contain approximate number of facts dropped (e.g. `2 thousands`). The maximum amount of facts is configurable via Administer - Settings - Provisioning. This change was implemented for large deployments with many nodes and/or hypervisors or container hosts with many virtual network cards, bridges, mountpoints or volumes. The list of root nodes filtered out:
  * blockdevice_
  * ipaddress6?_
  * macaddress_
  * mtu_
  * speed_
  * auto_negotiation_
  * duplex_
  * link_
  * wol_
* Updating a nested resource in the API with a non existing id will no longer fail with the response status code `404 Not Found`, But it will instead fail with `422 Unprocessable Entity` and will present a correct error message. [#26754](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/26754)
* Multiple methods and tasks that have been deprecated over the past few releases have been removed. Especially noteworthy:
  * Operating sytems methods `repos` and `medium_uri` have been removed. `pxe_files` method now accepts only one parameter, a medium provider.
  * Template macro `snippets` has been removed in favor of `snippet` macro. The `@repos` template variable has also been removed.
  * Rake tasks `puppet:import:puppet_classes` and `puppet:import:environments_only` have been removed. These actions should be done by using the matching UI or API actions.
  * The `foreman-config` script has been removed. Use `foreman-rake config` instead.
* The `Host group matchers inheritance` puppet setting has been renamed to `Matchers inheritance`. This setting will now manage puppet smart class parameter's matchers inheritance for hostgroups (as in the past) and taxonomies (organizations and locations). With this change it will be possible to inherit (and possibly merge if value's type permit it) values from parent taxonomies as it was already the case for hostgroups.
