* Ensure AMIs are added under the *Images* tab on the compute resource with the correct username for it to SSH into the image.
* Add a provisioning template of type *finish* which will be executed over SSH on the new image.
* Ensure the finish template is associated to the OS (on the *Associations* tab) and is set as the default for the operating system too.
* Enabling *use_uuid_for_certificates* in *More > Settings* is recommended for consistent Puppet certificate IDs instead of hostnames.
* Currently doesn't support VPC, see [issue #1871](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/1871).
