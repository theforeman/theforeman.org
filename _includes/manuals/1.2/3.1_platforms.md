The following operating systems are supported by the installer, have packages and are tested for deploying Foreman:

* RHEL derivatives (CentOS), 5 and 6
  * [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) is required
  * On RHEL 6, subscribe to the "optional" child channel
* Fedora 17, 18
* Debian 7 (Wheeze)
* Debian 6 (Squeeze)
  * Ensure Puppet is updated from backports
* Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise)

All platforms will require Puppet 2.6.5 or higher.  Puppet 3.x is supported and may be installed from the Puppet Labs repositories.

Other operating systems will need to use alternative installation methods, such as from source.  Using Foreman with SELinux in Enforcing mode is [not currently supported](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/2125).

The following operating systems are known to install successfully from Foreman:

* RHEL derivatives (CentOS) 3+
* Fedora
* Ubuntu
* Debian
* Solaris 8, 10
* OpenSUSE 11.4
