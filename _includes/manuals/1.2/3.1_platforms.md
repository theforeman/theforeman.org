The following operating systems are supported by the installer, have packages and are tested for deploying Foreman:

* RHEL derivatives (CentOS) version 6

  * On RHEL 6, subscribe to the "optional" child channel
* Fedora 18, 19
* Debian 7 (Wheeze)

Other operating systems will need to use alternative installation methods, such as from source.

* RHEL derivatives (CentOS) 3+
