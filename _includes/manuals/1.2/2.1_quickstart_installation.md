[The Foreman installer](/manuals/1.2/index.html#3.2ForemanInstaller) uses Puppet to install Foreman. This guide assumes that you've already installed Puppet (without a master), but the installer will setup Foreman and the puppet master with Passenger and the [Smart Proxy](/manuals/1.2/index.html#4.3SmartProxies) by default.

#### Downloading the installer

For **Red Hat variants**, run this (replace 'el6' with 'f18' or 'f19' as appropriate):

{% highlight bash %}
yum -y install http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.2/el6/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm
yum -y install foreman-installer
{% endhighlight %}

For **Debian variants**, run this (replace 'wheezy' with 'precise' if on Ubuntu 12.04, or 'squeeze' for Debian 6):

{% highlight bash %}
echo "deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ wheezy stable" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/foreman.list
wget -q http://deb.theforeman.org/pubkey.gpg -O- | apt-key add -
apt-get update && apt-get install foreman-installer
{% endhighlight %}

#### Running the installer

The procedure is initially interactive, allowing changes to the configuration and then the option is given to run Puppet to perform the installation:

{% highlight bash %}
ruby /usr/share/foreman-installer/generate_answers.rb
{% endhighlight %}

After Puppet runs, Foreman will be accessible at `https://fqdn/` with a default
username/password of "admin" and "changeme".  To complete the installation,
click on *More > Configuration > Smart Proxies* and add a new proxy with the URL `https://fqdn:8443/`.
