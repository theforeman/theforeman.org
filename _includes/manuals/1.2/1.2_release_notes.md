## Release notes for 1.2

### Headline features

#### Discovery plugin support

[foreman_discovery](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_discovery) is supported with Foreman 1.2 and provides Metal-as-a-Service hardware discovery.  New hosts boot into a discovery image which registers with Foreman, then can be converted and built from the web interface.  See the [README file](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_discovery#readme) for a step by step guide to configuring Foreman and the plugin.

#### BMC and IPMI support

Power control and boot device controls are now available from the web interface for bare metal hosts with a BMC network interface configured.  The BMC interface can be added under the host network tab, and a smart proxy with the BMC feature configured is also required to perform actions over IPMI.

#### Internationalization

The web interface has been internationalized and now supports German, Spanish and French.  The interface will switch to the language specified by the browser by default and can be overridden from the user settings within Foreman.  Further translations are welcomed through the [Foreman project](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/foreman/) on Transifex.

#### SPICE HTML5 support

Virtual machine consoles on oVirt hosts can now be viewed from any HTML5-capable browser, instead of requiring the Linux-only XPI plugin.  The XPI view is still available via the "New Window" link.

#### SELinux targeted support

An SELinux module for the standard targeted policy is now shipped in the foreman-selinux subpackage, supporting all standard configurations and options of Foreman.  Please file any AVCs caused by Foreman or common plugins as bugs.

#### PostgreSQL by default

The Foreman installer default database has changed from SQLite to PostgreSQL, providing increased performance and reducing concurrency errors seen even in very small environments.  MySQL is also fully supported and can be selected as an alternative.  Database management in the installer modules can also be disabled, see [this announcement](http://groups.google.com/group/foreman-dev/browse_thread/thread/3619659e71994ccc) for details.

#### Puppet runs via MCollective

The smart proxy can now initiate Puppet runs via the MCollective "puppet" agent, when configured with `:puppet_provider: mcollective` ([documentation](manuals/1.2/index.html#4.3.2SmartProxySettings)).

#### API version 2

A new "experimental" API version (v2) has been added, providing new features while retaining API v1 compatibility.  API v1 still remains the default version.  To use API v2, users must pass "version=2" in the header. For example:

curl -u admin:secret -H 'Accept:application/json,version=2' http://example.com/api/locations

New API v2 features include adding and removing puppet classes to hosts and host groups, CRUD for locations and organizations, and managing regular parameters for hosts, host groups, domains and operating systems (not smart parameters).

This also marks the official deprecation of the pre-1.1 API (non `/api` paths), see notes below.

#### Security fixes

* Fix remote code execution in Foreman via bookmarks storage (CVE-2013-2121)
* Fix role privilege escalation by users with create/edit user privileges (CVE-2013-2113)
* Fix arbitrary remote execution risk in Puppet run smart proxy API (CVE-2013-0210)

### Upgrade notes

#### Changes to production deployment for non-package users

For users running Foreman from git instead of RPMs or Debian packages, two additional deployment steps are now required for production usage:

* `rake locale:pack` to compile locale .mo files
* `rake assets:precompile` to compile images, JavaScript etc.

#### Software collections in RPMs

The RPMs now provide a full Ruby 1.9 stack via software collections (SCL), complete with the version of Ruby on Rails and other dependencies used by Foreman.  This allows for a single stack of packages across each supported RPM-based distro, plus easier support of future dependencies as Ruby 1.8 goes EOL upstream.  The software collection is installed under `/opt/rh/ruby193`.

This changes any `rake` or `ruby` commands used for managing Foreman, which now become `ruby193-rake` and `ruby193-ruby` respectively.  Commands can also be run with `scl enable ruby193 'original command'` to run in the context of the collection (note the quotes).

More about software collections is available in the [Software Collections](manuals/1.2/index.html#3.3.2SoftwareCollections) manual section.  Please note the upgrade instructions below, particularly for Passenger configuration.

#### Host group matcher inheritance

Matchers used in smart variables or class parameters to match host groups are now inherited by children of those matching host groups too (e.g. a matcher for `hostgroup=Base` will also apply to `Base/Web`).  This behaviour can be reverted by the host_group_matchers_inheritance setting (More &gt; Settings &gt; Puppet).

#### ActiveRecord-based storeconfigs / database sharing now unsupported

Previously it was suggested that a single database could be shared between Puppet ActiveRecord-based storeconfigs and Foreman, which would be used to import data from Puppet - this configuration was deprecated in Foreman 1.1 and is now unsupported in 1.2.  Foreman must be configured with a standalone database, then configure either an ENC or fact and report uploads, which provides most of the same functionality as database sharing without the associated issues.

Puppet 3 also deprecated the use of ActiveRecord-based storeconfigs and it is now recommended to use PuppetDB instead for storeconfigs and exported resources. This can be used alongside Foreman as the two do not need to interact.

#### Pre-1.1 API (non-/api) is deprecated

The older API is now deprecated and users should migrate to [the versioned API at `/api`](/api.html), available since Foreman 1.1.  If you use paths such as `/hosts` rather than `/api/hosts` then you are using the pre-1.1 API and should change your program to use the new one.

#### Error after upgrade: ArgumentError (dump format error (user class))

If you see the following error in production.log, clear cookies in your browser:

    ArgumentError (dump format error (user class)):
      /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-4.0.5/lib/phusion_passenger/rack/thread_handler_extension.rb:77:in `process_request'

#### VMware compute resource public keys need updating

When the Ruby version changes during an upgrade, an issue will be hit with VMware compute resources as the hash of the public key used to identify vSphere will change.  This will happen when upgrading an RPM installation, since it switches from Ruby 1.8 to 1.9.

To resolve, an admin user should browse to the compute resource in Foreman and click "Test Connection", which will update the public key on record.

#### Package upgrade instructions

Please see the end of the package sections for each platform for specific upgrade instructions:

* [RPM packages](manuals/1.2/index.html#3.3.1RPMPackages)
* [Debian packages](manuals/1.2/index.html#3.3.3DebianPackages)

If you have problems with Passenger after upgrading the RPMs, please see [the SCL section](manuals/1.2/index.html#3.3.2SoftwareCollections) for information about the expected configuration.
