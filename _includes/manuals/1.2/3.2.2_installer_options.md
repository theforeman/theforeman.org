The installer is a collection of Puppet modules that can be operated using an answers file distributed inside the foreman_installer module.  This is located at `/usr/share/foreman-installer/foreman_installer/answers.yaml` in the foreman-installer packages.

The answers file describes the classes that will be applied to the host to install Foreman.  By default, the "all-in-one" setup will include Foreman, a puppet master and the Smart Proxy:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
foreman: true
puppet: true
puppetmaster: true
foreman_proxy: true
{% endhighlight %}

This can be customized for your site by copying `/usr/share/foreman-installer/foreman_installer/answers.yaml` to `/etc/foreman-installer/answers.yaml` and editing.  For example, a standalone puppet master and Smart Proxy can use:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
foreman: false
puppet: true
puppetmaster: true
foreman_proxy: true
{% endhighlight %}

Other examples are given in `/usr/share/foreman-installer/README.md`.  The installer itself provides a text driven interface to generate this answers file, and can be run by executing:

{% highlight bash %}
ruby /usr/share/foreman-installer/generate_answers.rb
{% endhighlight %}
