Architectures are simple objects, usually created by Foreman automatically when Hosts check in via Puppet. However, none are created by default, so you may need to create them if you're not using Foreman for reporting.

#### Creating a new Architecture

Simply click *New Architecture* to create a new one. This should match the Facter fact *:architecture* e.g. "x86_64". If you've already created some Operating Systems, you can associate the Architecture with the OS now; if not, the list of Architectures will be present when you create an OS.
