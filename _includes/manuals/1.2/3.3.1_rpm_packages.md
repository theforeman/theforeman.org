We maintain a repository for RHEL and Fedora (and clones) - you may add it via:

### Release

1. For RHEL 6 ensure your system is subscribed to EPEL. 

    For RHEL 5 you will need to be subscribed to both EPEL and the RHEL Virtualization RHN Channel.
    Also be advised, the Foreman repo will Ruby to 1.8.7 on RHEL 5. This has
    the potential to break stuff (like passenger, notes on getting it working again below), 
    so be sure you want to proceed before committing to the installation.

    <pre>http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL</pre>

2. Install the foreman-release.rpm for your version of RHEL or Fedora.

    x86_64 architecture:
    <pre>
    yum localinstall http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.2/el5/x86_64/foreman-release-1.2stable-3.el5.noarch.rpm
    yum localinstall http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.2/el6/x86_64/foreman-release-1.2stable-3.el6.noarch.rpm
    yum localinstall http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.2/f16/x86_64/foreman-release-1.2stable-3.fc16.noarch.rpm
    yum localinstall http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.2/f17/x86_64/foreman-release-1.2stable-3.fc17.noarch.rpm</pre>

    i386 architecture:
    <pre>
    yum localinstall http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.2/el5/i386/foreman-release-1.2stable-3.el5.noarch.rpm
    yum localinstall http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.2/el6/i386/foreman-release-1.2stable-3.el6.noarch.rpm
    yum localinstall http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.2/f16/i386/foreman-release-1.2stable-3.fc16.noarch.rpm
    yum localinstall http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.2/f17/i386/foreman-release-1.2stable-3.fc17.noarch.rpm</pre>

3. Install foreman and other foreman-* packages to add functionality:
    <pre>
    foreman               Foreman server
    foreman-proxy         Foreman Smart Proxy
    foreman-cli           Foreman CLI utility
    foreman-libvirt       libvirt provisioning support
    foreman-ovirt         ovirt/RHEV provisioning support
    foreman-ec2           EC2 provisioning support
    foreman-vmware        VMware provisioning support
    foreman-console       Console additions
    foreman-mysql         MySQL database support
    foreman-mysql2        MySQL database support
    foreman-postgresql    PostgreSQL database support
    foreman-sqlite        SQLite database support
    foreman-test          Testing support (dependency rpm's not built yet)
    foreman-devel         Development support (dependency rpm's not built yet)</pre>

4. Configure
    <pre>
    Edit /etc/foreman/settings.yaml and /etc/foreman/database.yml
    su - foreman -s /bin/bash -c /usr/share/foreman/extras/dbmigrate</pre>

5. Start the foreman service or set up passenger
    <pre>service foreman start</pre>

6. Set up Passenger

    On RHEL5 the RPM's at the URL above will not run after updating ruby. Fortunately it is fairly easy to get it working again. 
    After foreman is installed ensure /usr/sbin is in your path so that the axps binary can be found, otherwise the rpm's may 
    fail to build while complaining about being unable to find some files. Then do the following:
    <pre>
    yum localinstall http://passenger.stealthymonkeys.com/rhel/5/x86_64/rubygem-daemon_controller-0.2.5-1.noarch.rpm
    wget http://passenger.stealthymonkeys.com/SRPMS/rubygem-passenger-3.0.12-1.src.rpm 
    yum-builddep rubygem-passenger-3.0.12-1.src.rpm 
    rpmbuild --rebuild rubygem-passenger-3.0.12-1.src.rpm</pre>

### Development

1. For RHEL 6 ensure your system is subscribed to EPEL. 

    For RHEL 5 you will need to be subscribed to both EPEL and the RHEL Virtualization RHN Channel.
    Also be advised, that on RHEL5 the Foreman Repo will update Ruby to version 1.8.7. This has 
    the potential to break stuff (like passenger, notes on getting it working again below), 
    so be sure you want to proceed before committing to the installation.
