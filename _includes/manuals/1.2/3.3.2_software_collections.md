The RPMs use a packaging technique called Software Collections, or SCL.  This provides Ruby and all dependencies required to run Foreman separately from the version of Ruby provided by the distribution.

The current stack is "ruby193", which provides Ruby 1.9.3 and Ruby on Rails 3.2.  All packages will have a "ruby193-" prefix, allowing them to be easily identified, and will install entirely underneath `/opt/rh/ruby193`.

The system Ruby version is left alone and will still be used for packages provided both by the distribution, and other third parties who target the system Ruby (e.g. Puppet packages).

In order to run rake commands for Foreman, or scripts that run in the same environment, `ruby193-rake` and `ruby193-ruby` wrappers are provided as alternatives for the usual `rake` or `ruby`.  In order to run a series of commands or a script directly within the software collection, `scl enable ruby193 'other command'` can be used.  It is also possible to run `scl enable ruby193 bash` to get a shell within the context of the SCL.
