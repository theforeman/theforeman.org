* In order to improve logging experience, the following Rails middleware was
moved to separate files and under Foreman Ruby namespace:
Middleware::LoggingContext, Middleware::CatchJsonParseErrors,
Middleware::Telemetry. Plugins using `config.middleware.insert_before` or
`config.middleware.insert_after` must update the statements accordingly
([#25619](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/25619)).
