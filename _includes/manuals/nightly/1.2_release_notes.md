### Upgrade warnings

* Administer - Settings - Provisioning - DNS conflict timeout has been changed from integer to array of values (separated by comma). It used to represent timeout (in seconds) for DNS lookup attempts (dns_lookup macro and DNS record conflict validations). Multiple values in the array now represent multiple attempts to resolve name over DNS with the default value of [5, 10, 15, 20]. If this value was modified however, upgrade process will keep it. It's recommended to change it to perform multiple DNS query attempts.
