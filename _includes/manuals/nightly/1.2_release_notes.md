## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

### Upgrade warnings

#### `require_ssl_smart_proxies` setting dropped

The `require_ssl_smart_proxies` setting has been dropped and Foreman now behaves as if the value was true (the default). This means it's no longer possible to use reverse DNS instead of client certificates over HTTPS connections. Upgrading users should ensure a valid Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) exists.

For more information see the [RFC](https://community.theforeman.org/t/drop-require-ssl-and-require-ssl-smart-proxies-settings/26772) and [PR](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/pull/9021).

### Deprecations

#### Running Foreman on EL7

Foreman 2.1 introduced EL8 support and Katello 4.0 (on Foreman 2.4) followed.
While it's currently undecided when EL7 support will be dropped exactly, this is an early notice given the considerable number of EL7 deployments.
For fresh installations, EL8 should considered the preferred target.
Existing installations should start thinking about a migration plan.

Note that this is only support to run Foreman and Foreman Proxy themselves on EL7. Managing EL7 systems remains supported. See [the RFC](https://community.theforeman.org/t/deprecation-plans-for-foreman-on-el7-debian-10-and-ubuntu-18-04/25008) for more information.
