### Release Notes

### Deprecations

* Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) is deprecated and will no longer be supported starting from Foreman 1.25. Users are urged to upgrade their base OS to Ubuntu Bionic (18.04).
* [#27048](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27048) Smart Proxy DNS module methods `get_name, get_name!, get_ipv4_address, get_ipv4_address!, get_ipv6_address, get_ipv6_address!, get_resource_as_string, get_resource_as_string!` were marked as deprecated and scheduled for removal in 1.24. They have been unused in the Smart Proxy since 1.16 but kept around for plugins. If you're a Smart Proxy DNS Plugin author, make sure you migrate away from them before 1.24.

### Upgrade warnings

* [#27047](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27047) The Smart Proxy DNS module method `dns_find` was removed after being deprecated in 1.14. Using the function generated a warning in the logs but the common providers (built in, Route53, PowerDNS) have been upgraded and no user impact is expected.
* [#27047](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/27047) The Smart Proxy DNS module method behavior `ptr_record_conflicts` changed and no longer accepts strings. This was deprecated in 1.16 and generated warnings in the logs. The common providers (built in, Route53, PowerDNS) have been upgraded and no user impact is expected.
