### Upgrade warnings

* The DNS conflict timeout setting (found under Provisioning) has been changed from an integer to an array of values (separated by comma). It's also renamed to `DNS timeout`. It used to represent timeout (in seconds) for DNS lookup attempts such as the dns_lookup macro and DNS record conflict validations. Multiple values in the array now represent multiple attempts to resolve name over DNS with the default value of [5, 10, 15, 20]. If this value was modified however, the upgrade process will keep the single value. This means there's no retry. Users who've changed this value should review the new value.
* Foreman no longer imports all facts, structured facts (e.g. `networking::interface`) and selected root facts (identified by hardcoded list - see below) are imported up to 100 elements. If a host reports more, they will be dropped and fact named `foreman::dropped_subtree_facts` will contain approximate number of facts dropped (e.g. `2 thousands`). The maximum amount of facts is configurable via Administer - Settings - Provisioning. This change was implemented for large deployments with many nodes and/or hypervisors or container hosts with many virtual network cards, bridges, mountpoints or volumes. The list of root nodes filtered out:
  * blockdevice_
  * ipaddress6?_
  * macaddress_
  * mtu_
  * speed_
  * auto_negotiation_
  * duplex_
  * link_
  * wol_
