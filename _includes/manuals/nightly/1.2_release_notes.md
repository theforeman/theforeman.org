### Release Notes

### Deprecations

### Upgrade warnings

* Due to changes in the build process, the API docs shipped with foreman and its plugins will no longer contain information about the data types of search fields. These will still be available in the API documentation on the website, and can be generated locally if needed by running `foreman-rake apipie:cache` on your Foreman server.

* The RPM packages are not tested on Scientific Linux or Oracle Linux. The Foreman installation on Scientific Linux or Oracle Linux may or may not work.
