## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) support

Packages for Foreman and its various plug-ins are now being built for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) as well.

#### CentOS 8 Stream support

Packages for Foreman and its various plug-ins that are built for CentOS 8 are now being tested on CentOS 8 Stream as well.

### Upgrade warnings

#### Removal of mod_passenger support

After defaulting to Puma in Foreman 2.1 and deprecation in Foreman 2.4, support for [mod_passenger is dropped](https://community.theforeman.org/t/drop-passenger-support/22787). The packages have been dropped and the installer can no longer configure it. Users who upgrade using the installer will be migrated automatically but users who upgrade without the installer must take care of this themselves.

### Deprecations

#### Puppet host methods in templates

Methods on the Host object used to configure Puppet have been deprecated in favor of dedicated macros. The old methods will issue a deprecation warning and be removed in a future release.

This is the list of deprecated methods and their successor:
- `@host.environment` -> `host_puppet_environment`
- `@host.puppetmaster` -> `host_puppet_server`
- `@host.puppet_ca_server` -> `host_puppet_ca_server`

#### Puppet 5

Puppet 5 is officially End of Life. Foreman {{page.version}} still supports Puppet 5, but in a future release this will be removed.
