### Release Notes

### Deprecations

#### Puppet host methods in templates

Methods on the Host object used to configure Puppet have been deprecated in favor of dedicated macros. The old methods will issue a deprecation warning and be removed in a future release.

This is the list of deprecated methods and their successor:
- `@host.environment` -> `host_puppet_environment`
- `@host.puppetmaster` -> `host_puppet_server`
- `@host.puppet_ca_server` -> `host_puppet_ca_server`

#### Puppet 5

Puppet 5 is officially End of Life. Foreman {{page.version}} still supports Puppet 5, but in a future release this will be removed.
