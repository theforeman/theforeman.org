## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### API pagination supports 'all'

Foreman API resource listings support pagination. Foreman 2.2 introduces 'all' as a valid value for the `per_page` parameter, which can be used to fetch all records in one request. The returned data structure is unchanged and contains pagination information for a consistent API experience. Care must be taken since some requests might be very expensive but it's a better alternative than specifying a very high number with the same goal.

#### Templates DSL documentation

Foreman now has documentation for DSL used for templates writing. This should
make template writing process easier for non-Rubyists as well as for people who
aren't familiar with all the methods Foreman provides. Documentation is available
locally under `https://<fqdn>/templates_doc`. This documentation will be gradually
enhanced in future releases to cover all available methods and macros.

#### VM deletion behavior change

Until now, the default installation sets the `destroy_vm_on_host_delete` setting to true, meaning associate VM is automatically deleted upon host deletion. This cause a lot of pain for users, who did not expect such behavior and deleted their production machines, when they simply wanted to drop the Foreman definition. The default behavior now changes and VMs remain running on the hypervisor or in the cloud. This can cause problems in case, user pay for the VM resources. If you prefer to delete the VM automatically upon host deletion, switch this setting back to true.

### Release Notes

### Deprecations

### Upgrade warnings

* Trends and statistics are now moved to separate plugin. See [manual](/plugins/foreman_statistics) of the new Statistics plugin if you wish continue using it.
* TFTP integration is now [disabled by default](https://community.theforeman.org/t/disable-foreman-proxy-tftp-support-by-default/18892). Upgrades are unaffected. To enable TFTP integration, `--foreman-proxy-tftp true` must be passed to the installer command.
