## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### Kerberos authentication using mod_auth_gssapi

The installer will now deploy `mod_auth_gssapi` instead of `mod_auth_kerb` if called with `--foreman-ipa-authentication=true`.
Existing installations will be upgraded to use `mod_auth_gssapi` too.
This allows deploying Kerberos authentication on CentOS 8, which lacks `mod_auth_kerb`.
Debian and Ubuntu also provide `mod_auth_gssapi` and the installer can now deploy Kerberos authentication there too.

### Upgrade warnings

* The `view_bookmarks` permission has been removed. All users are able to see their own bookmarks and any public bookmark defined by others.
* The `enable-epel` parameter now defaults to `false`. If you still want to enable EPEL at provisioning time, you will need to explicitly set the parameter to `true`.
