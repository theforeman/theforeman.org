Foreman is a Rails application. While Rails supports different databases, Foreman supports only PostgreSQL for production deployments.

The database configuration file can be found at:

`/etc/foreman/database.yml`

<div class="alert alert-info">When using PostgreSQL, you should make sure that the foreman-postgresql package is installed. See <a href="manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.3InstallFromPackages">3.3 Install From Packages</a>.</div>

Edit your config/database.yml and modify:
```yaml
production:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: foreman
  username: foreman
  password: password
  host: localhost
```
