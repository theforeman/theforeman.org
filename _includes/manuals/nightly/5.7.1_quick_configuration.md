We assume the Foreman machine is FreeIPA-enrolled:
{% highlight bash %}
ipa-client-install
{% endhighlight %}

On the FreeIPA server, we create the service.
(Please make sure you have obtained Kerberos ticket before this step - for example, by using *kinit*.)
{% highlight bash %}
ipa service-add HTTP/<the-foreman-fqdn>
{% endhighlight %}

Then we install Foreman.
{% highlight bash %}
foreman-installer --foreman-ipa-authentication=true
{% endhighlight %}
This option can be used for the reconfiguration of existing installation as well.

In case you want to use IPA server's host-based access control (HBAC) features (make sure *allow_all* rule is disabled), the default PAM service name (which would be matched by HBAC service name) is *foreman*. You can override the default name with:
{% highlight bash %}
foreman-installer --foreman-ipa-authentication=true --foreman-pam-service=<pam_service_name>
{% endhighlight %}

For more information about HBAC configuration see section below.
