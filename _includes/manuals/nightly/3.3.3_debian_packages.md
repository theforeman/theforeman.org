The Foreman packages should work on the following Debian-based Linux distributions:

#### Distributions

* Debian Linux 10 (Buster), amd64
* Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver), amd64

If you encounter any errors during the installation, [please file a bug report!](/contribute.html#Bugreporting)

#### Apt Configuration

Add one of the following lines to your */etc/apt/sources.list* (alternatively in a separate file in */etc/apt/sources.list.d/foreman.list*):

{% highlight bash %}
# Stable packages

# Debian Buster
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ buster {{page.version}}
# Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ bionic {{page.version}}
# Ubuntu 20.04 Focal
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ focal {{page.version}}

# Nightly builds. Beware: HERE BE DRAGONS

# Debian Buster
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ buster nightly
# Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ bionic nightly
# Ubuntu 20.04 Focal
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ focal nightly
{% endhighlight %}

You may also want some plugins from the plugin repo (required for the Foreman Installer):
{% highlight bash %}
# Plugins compatible with Stable
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ plugins {{page.version}}
# Plugins compatible with Nightly
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ plugins nightly
{% endhighlight %}

The public key for [secure APT](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt) can be downloaded [here](https://deb.theforeman.org/pubkey.gpg)

You can add this key with
```
apt-key add pubkey.gpg
```

or combine downloading and registering:
```
wget -q https://deb.theforeman.org/pubkey.gpg -O- | apt-key add -
```

The key fingerprint is

Foreman Automatic Signing Key (2016) <packages@theforeman.org>
```

Remember to update your package lists!

```
apt-get update
```

#### Install packages

The packages are now split by gem dependencies - there are 11 packages to choose from. These are:

Main package:

* foreman

Database gems:

* foreman-pgsql

Optional functionality:

* foreman-console
* foreman-debug
* foreman-ec2
* foreman-gce
* foreman-libvirt
* foreman-openstack
* foreman-ovirt
* foreman-test
* foreman-vmware

Command line interface:

* ruby-hammer-cli
* ruby-hammer-cli-foreman

Installation instructions are:

{% highlight bash %}
# Install packages  (adjust additional packages as needed)
apt-get install foreman foreman-pgsql foreman-libvirt

# Copy sample db config to /etc
cp /usr/share/foreman/config/database.yml.example /etc/foreman/database.yml

# Review settings and DB config
vi /etc/foreman/settings.yaml /etc/foreman/database.yml

# Perform initial DB setup
foreman-rake db:migrate
foreman-rake db:seed
{% endhighlight %}

The packages should auto-run db:migrate and db:seed if */etc/foreman/database.yml* exists. So the initial DB setup is only needed during first install, upgrades should just work.

#### Upgrade

See [upgrade instructions](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.6Upgrade)
