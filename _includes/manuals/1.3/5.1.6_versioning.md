The default API version is v1 for Foreman 1.3.x

There are two methods of selecting API v2:

1. In the **header**, pass `Accept: application/json,version=2`

2. In the **URL**, pass /v2/ such as `GET /api/v2/hosts`

Similarly, when API version v2 becomes the default, users will still be able to use v1 by passing `Accept: application/json,version=1` in the header or `api/v1/` in the URL.
