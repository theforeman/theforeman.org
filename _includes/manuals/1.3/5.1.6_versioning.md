The default API version is v1 for Foreman 1.3.

There are two ways to use API version to v2, which is experimental and may have breaking changes in the future until it is officially released.

Option #1) pass `Accept: version=2,application/json` in header.

Option #2) pass /v2/ in the URL route, such as /api/v2/hosts

Similarly, when API version v2 is the default, then users will still be able to use v1 by passing `Accept: version=2,application/json` in the header or api/v1/ in the URL.
