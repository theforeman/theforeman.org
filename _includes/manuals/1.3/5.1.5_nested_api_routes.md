The goal is to implement nested routes for all objects as an alternative to filtering collections.

For example, rather then filtering subnets by a specified domain using a search string

    $ GET /api/subnets?search=name%3Dqa.lab.example.com

the alternative nested route below returns the same result as the above.

    $ GET /api/domains/qa.lab.example.com/subnets

All actions will be accessible in the nested route as in the main route.
