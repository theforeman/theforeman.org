Collection responses are used for `index` actions.

The default root node title is configurable, but defaults to `results`.

The collection response contains metadata:

* `total` - total number of objects without any search parameters
* `subtotal` - number of objects returned with given search parameters (if there is no search, then `subtotal` would be the same as `total`)
* `limit` - number of objects return in this API call (for instance, if there are a total of 27 objects, `per_page` is 20, and you're on `page` 2, then only 7 objects would be returned, so the `limit` would be 7)
* `offset` - index offset from the first item in the collection
* `page` - page number
* `per_page` - objects per page
* `search` - search term used
* `sort`
    * `by` - the field that the collection is sorted by
    * `order` - sorted in ascending or descending order
* `results` - list (or collection) of objects; number of objects returned for a special call is equal to `limit`

The fields included in the `main.json.rabl` view will be included for each object in the collection.
