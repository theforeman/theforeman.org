Three main views for each object

1. `base.json.rabl` (small) - minimal fields such as `id`, `name`

2. `main.json.rabl` (medium) - "important" fields excluding any associated objects (`has_many`)

3. `show.json.rabl` (large) - all fields on an object including some/all associated objects (`has_many`)

Include timestamps in the `main.json.rabl` and `show.json.rabl` partials. If an object is associated with another object (`belongs_to`), include the `_id` and `_name` references (ex. `environment_id`, `environment_name`).
