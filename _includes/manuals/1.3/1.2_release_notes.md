## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features

#### New installer

A new installer based on the
[kafo](https://github.com/theforeman/kafo) project is available. Refer to the
[installation section](/manuals/1.3/index.html#3.2ForemanInstaller) of the
manual for more information.

#### Smart-proxy auto-registration

In the default all-in-one setup, the smart-proxy is automatically registered
in the Foreman UI, using the API during installation.
You can change that behavior with
`register_in_foreman` puppet class parameter (or installer option
`--foreman-proxy-register-in-foreman`).

The install module that manages Puppet was refactored, the puppet::server
class is now top level. Please review updated
[readme](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-puppet/blob/master/README.md) if
you install Foreman directly via your Puppet infrastructure.

#### Foreman CLI

Brand new command-line interface for Foreman codenamed "Hammer" is introduced
by this release. The first version, which is released with Foreman 1.3, is not
yet feature-complete and should be treated as a "preview".

To install the new Foreman command line client, install package
`rubygem-hammer_cli_foreman` first and run:

    hammer -h

#### Compute resources additions

Support for Amazon EC2's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) feature has been added,
allowing selection of VPC security groups when creating new hosts.

Support for Google Compute Engine as a compute resource has been added.
Packages are unavailable in RC1 due to the late addition, but should follow.
This implementation is currently in beta state.

Since web-based VNC/SPICE console is popular, we have added possibility to
set VNC password for libvirt and VMware resources which helps to integrate with
VMs created outside Foreman too.  SPICE support can now be enabled for libvirt
VMs too.

Compute resource passwords can now be encrypted in the database.

#### Bare metal association

VM and host records can be now matched via MAC address, either all at once by
clicking on Associate VMs at the Compute Resource level, or the Associate
button, if available on the compute resource VM. There is logic to determine
if it is capable of matching a host.

#### LDAP filtering

It is now possible to to restrict LDAP authentication to a security group which
was highly demanded feature. In the LDAP definition dialog, there is new field
called "Custom LDAP search filter" which can be used for that purpose.

#### Host IP updating

A nice and handy feature which is useful when you have no Puppet Master and
using token-based templates. Before Foreman 1.3, there was no other way to get
the IP updated, now foreman does that automatically when
"update_ip_from_built_request" setting is set.

#### Plugins as RPM packages

Various plugins have been packaged as RPMs for easy installation, including
foreman_discovery, foreman_content, foreman_hooks, or foreman_simplify. For
the whole list head over to [plugin
documentation](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/How_to_Install_a_Plugin).

#### API v2 improvements

The new "experimental" API version (v2) has been improved, providing new
features while retaining API compatibility.  API v1 still remains the default
version.  To use API v2, users must pass "version=2" in the header. For
example:

    curl -u admin:secret -H 'Accept:application/json,version=2' http://abc.com/api/locations

New features include REMOTE_USER support, data format consolidation, better
logging, documentation, smart classes support, network interfaces, power
management and boot device APIs.

### New translations

Foreman {{page.version}} is now fully translated into (in alphabetical order):

- British English
- Chinese Simplified
- French
- Galcian
- German
- Spanish

Join the translation effort now at [transifex.com
site](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/foreman/).

### Upgrade notes

#### Puppet dependency removed

Puppet dependency was removed from Foreman core, so all Puppet usage is in the
smart proxy only. This will make it optional for people who don't use Puppet,
plus avoid conflicts when loading Puppet as a library. In addition, if
puppetmaster is not on the same server as Foreman, Puppet no longer needs to
be installed there at all.

To accomplish this, the way facts and reports are uploaded was changed.
Specifically, Foreman itself now uses a JSON format, and the ENC (node.rb) and
Puppet report processor (foreman.rb) have been updated to handle changing
Puppet-specific data into JSON. Existing ENC/Reports scripts will need a
change to the latest version, which can be found in the installer git repository:

- [external_node_v2.rb.erb](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman/tree/master/templates/external_node_v2.rb.erb)
- [foreman-report_v2.rb.erb](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman/tree/master/templates/foreman-report_v2.rb.erb)

#### Read-only settings

Configuration values defined via settings.yaml file are now presented in the
Foreman Settings page as read-only settings. Every time value is changed in
settings.yaml Foreman automatically updates the database. See
[#2764](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/2764) for more info.

#### API version 2 changes

The new API v2 is still work in progress, there are some changes to the API,
parameters and output format. We are working hard to stabilize this API in
future releases.

Large changes to the API v2 include replacement of api/lookup_keys by
api/smart_variables and api/smart_class_parameters (tickets [#2810](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/2810) and [#2142](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/2142)) or
removal of JSON roots ([#2803](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/2803)).

#### New foreman-rake command

A new `foreman-rake` command replaces the various `rake`
commands for running administrative tasks.
It is a wrapper around `rake` that changes to the correct user and
directory and on SCL-enabled systems also uses the `scl` command.
The foreman-rake command is provided in packages for all OSes to make
administration of Foreman consistent.

More information about software collections is available in the [Software
Collections](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.3.2SoftwareCollections)
manual section.
