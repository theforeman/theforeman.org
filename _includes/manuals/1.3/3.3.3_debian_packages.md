The Foreman packages should work on the following Debian-based Linux distributions:

#### Distributions

* Debian Linux 7.0 (Wheezy)
* Debian Linux 6.0 (Squeeze)
* Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS

Foreman might still work on these distros, but it has not been tested (let us know if it works for you):

* Debian Linux 5.0 (Lenny)
* Ubuntu Linux 11.04
* Ubuntu Linux 10.10

If you encounter any errors during the installation, [please file a bug report!](http://theforeman.org/projects/foreman/issues/new)

#### Apt Configuration

Add one of the following lines to your */etc/apt/sources.list* (alternatively in a separate file in */etc/apt/sources.list.d/foreman.list*):

{% highlight bash %}
# Stable packages

# Debian Wheezy
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ wheezy 1.3
# Debian Squeeze
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ squeeze 1.3
# Ubuntu Precise
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ precise 1.3

# Nightly builds. Beware: HERE BE DRAGONS

# Debian Wheezy
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ wheezy nightly
# Debian Squeeze
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ squeeze nightly
# Ubuntu Precise
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ precise nightly
{% endhighlight %}

You may also want some plugins from the plugin repo:
{% highlight bash %}
# Plugins compatible with Stable
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ plugins 1.3
# Plugins compatible with Nightly
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ plugins nightly
{% endhighlight %}

The public key for [secure APT](http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt) can be downloaded [here](http://deb.theforeman.org/foreman.asc)

You can add this key with
<pre>apt-key add foreman.asc</pre>

or combine downloading and registering:
<pre>wget -q http://deb.theforeman.org/foreman.asc -O- | apt-key add -</pre>

The key fingerprint is
<pre>

Foreman Archive Signing Key <packages@theforeman.org>
</pre>

Remember to update your package lists!

<pre>apt-get update</pre>

#### Install packages

The packages are now split by gem dependencies - there are 11 packages to choose from. These are:

Main package:

* foreman

Database gems - you need at least one of these:

* foreman-sqlite3
* foreman-mysql2
* foreman-mysql
* foreman-pgsql

Optional functionality:

* foreman-console
* foreman-compute
* foreman-libvirt
* foreman-ovirt
* foreman-test
* foreman-vmware

Command line interface:

* ruby-hammer-cli
* ruby-hammer-cli-foreman

Installation instructions are:

{% highlight bash %}
# Install packages  (adjust additional packages as needed)
apt-get install foreman foreman-sqlite3 foreman-libvirt

# Copy sample db config to /etc
cp /usr/share/foreman/config/database.yml.example /etc/foreman/database.yml

# Review settings and DB config
vi /etc/foreman/settings.yaml /etc/foreman/database.yml

# Perform initial DB setup
su - foreman -s /bin/bash -c /usr/share/foreman/extras/dbmigrate
{% endhighlight %}

The packages should auto-run db:migrate if */etc/foreman/database.yml* exists. So the initial db:migrate is only needed during first install, upgrades should just work.

#### Upgrade

See [upgrade instructions](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.6Upgrade)
