## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features
#### Ubuntu Bionic support
Packages for Foreman and its various plug-ins are now being built for Ubuntu Bionic as well.

#### Support for Puppet < 4.0 dropped
Foreman 1.19 does not support Puppet versions older than 4.0. Reports, fact processing and ENC with older versions may work in Foreman 1.19, but this workflow is not tested or supported. Users using older versions are recommended to upgrade their Puppet version prior to upgrading Foreman.

#### Hosts in Build Mode widget
A new dashboard widget has been added to the dashboard that displays hosts that have been put in build mode along with information regarding the build, as well as hosts that had failed to build. ([#22467](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/22467))

#### Puppet CA auto-signing has been moved to the host build queue
Previously, foreman called the smart proxy to create the autosign entry when the host requests its provisioning templates. This has now been moved into the orchestration process. ([#23626](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/23626))

#### Support for logging to journald or syslog
The installer now supports settings for configuring logging to use journald or syslog with structured logging support. ([#22559](https://theforeman.org/issues/22559))

#### Template support for reporting failed builds
A new endpoint has been added to the unattended controller that allows templates to report when a build has failed, providing users with further information allowing debugging such failures. ([#21007](https://theforeman.org/issues/21007))

#### Full cloud-init support for oVirt
Previously, the cloud-init integration for oVirt supported only a sub-set of cloud-init commands. With custom_script support, one can now pass arbitrary cloud-init yaml to the managed host and make sure the provisioned host will get it unchanged. ([#20590](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/20590))
