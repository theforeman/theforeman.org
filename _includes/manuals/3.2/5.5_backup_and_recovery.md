This chapter will provide you with information how to backup and recover
your instance. All commands presented here are just examples and should be
considered as a template command for your own backup script which differs from
one environment to other.

It is possible to perform a *migration* by doing backup one one host and
recovery on a different host, but in this case pay attention to different
configuration between the two hosts.

This can be applied to the Foreman application itself, but pay attention when
migrating smart-proxy and services because things like different IP addresses
or hostnames will need manual intervention.
