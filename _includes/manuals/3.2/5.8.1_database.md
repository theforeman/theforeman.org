All Foreman instances in a cluster/group must point to the same database. This can be done during the initial installation (through flags or altering `foreman_installer_answers.yaml`) or by directly altering `/etc/foreman/database.yaml` and pointing the correct environment (usually production) to your Foreman DB, then restarting Foreman.
