There are two proxy settings in Foreman to allow HTTP(s) communication through
firewalls.

*Global option*

In Administer - Settings - General menu there are two options available for
setting outgoing HTTP(s) proxy for all communication (e.g. to Smart Proxies,
Compute Resources):

* HTTP(S) proxy - hostname, port and optional credentials in the format of `http://[user:password@]HOST:PORT`
* HTTP(S) proxy except hosts - list of hostnames to exclude separated by commas

Both settings can also be configured via `settings.yaml` file via
`:http_proxy:` and `:http_proxy_except_list:` options.

*Infrastructure - HTTP Proxies page*

It is possible to configure multiple HTTP(s) proxies for various Compute
Resources. Each individual Compute Resources can be associated with a different
proxy. To create proxy URL, visit Infrastructure - HTTP Proxies and then
associate the proxy with a Compute Resource.

Currently HTTP Proxies are supported by the following Compute Resources:

* EC2
* Google Compute Engine

*Notes*

Both cases only affect outgoing HTTP(s) connection of the Foreman core
application (Ruby on Rails process). There are other plugins and components
running on a typical Foreman deployment (e.g. websocket proxy, Pulp, Candlepin)
and those services are not affected. Most of them can be configured separately.
