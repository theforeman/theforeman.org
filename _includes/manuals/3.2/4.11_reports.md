Foreman provides reporting capabilities. It uses the same templating engine
as for provisioning templates and partition tables. The list of macros that
can be used in this context slightly differs as reports are usually rendered
for a specific host. Reports do not enforce any output format as the formatting
is part of the template itself, the only requirement is, that the resulting
output is textual form.
