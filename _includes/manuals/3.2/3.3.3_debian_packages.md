The Foreman packages should work on the following Debian-based Linux distributions:

#### Distributions

* Debian Linux 10 (Buster), amd64
* Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa), amd64

If you encounter any errors during the installation, [please file a bug report!](/contribute.html#Bugreporting)

#### Apt Configuration

Add one of the following lines to your */etc/apt/sources.list* (alternatively in a separate file in */etc/apt/sources.list.d/foreman.list*):

```
# Debian Buster
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ buster {{page.version}}
# Ubuntu 20.04 Focal
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ focal {{page.version}}
```

You may also want some plugins from the plugin repo (required for the Foreman Installer):
```
deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ plugins {{page.version}}
```

The public key for [secure APT](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt) can be downloaded [here](https://deb.theforeman.org/pubkey.gpg)

You can add this key with:
```
wget https://deb.theforeman.org/foreman.asc -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/foreman.asc
```

The key fingerprint is

Foreman Automatic Signing Key (2021) <packages@theforeman.org>
```

Remember to update your package lists!

```
apt-get update
```

#### Install packages

The packages are split by gem dependencies - there are 15 packages to choose from. These are:

Main package:

* foreman

Database gems:

* foreman-postgresql

Optional functionality:

* foreman-console
* foreman-debug
* foreman-dynflow-sidekiq
* foreman-ec2
* foreman-gce
* foreman-journald
* foreman-libvirt
* foreman-openstack
* foreman-ovirt
* foreman-redis
* foreman-service
* foreman-telemetry
* foreman-vmware

Command line interface:

* ruby-hammer-cli
* ruby-hammer-cli-foreman

Installation instructions are:

```bash
# Install packages  (adjust additional packages as needed)
apt-get install foreman foreman-postgresql foreman-libvirt

# Copy sample db config to /etc
cp /usr/share/foreman/config/database.yml.example /etc/foreman/database.yml

# Review settings and DB config
vi /etc/foreman/settings.yaml /etc/foreman/database.yml

# Perform initial DB setup
foreman-rake db:migrate
foreman-rake db:seed
```

The packages should auto-run db:migrate and db:seed if */etc/foreman/database.yml* exists. So the initial DB setup is only needed during first install, upgrades should just work.

#### Upgrade
