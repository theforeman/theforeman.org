Foreman is packaged for the following RPM based distributions:

* RHEL and derivatives, version 8
* RHEL and derivatives, version 9

**Note:** The RPM packages are not tested on Rocky Linux or Oracle Linux. The Foreman installation on Rocky Linux or Oracle Linux may or may not work.

For most users, it's highly recommended to use the [installer](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.2ForemanInstaller) as the packages only provide the software and a standalone Foreman service.  The installer installs these packages, then additionally configures Foreman to run under Apache with PostgreSQL, plus can configure a complete Puppet setup integrated with Foreman.

### Pre-requisites: Puppet

It's recommended to [configure the Puppet repositories](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/install_agents.html#task-9788) to obtain the latest version of Puppet available. The version in EPEL is not supported.

### Available repositories

Three main repos are provided at <https://yum.theforeman.org>:

* `/client` or `/client/VERSION` (e.g. `/client/{{page.version}}`) carries packages relevant to clients. This is optional and Foreman does not require anything installed on clients.
* `/releases` or `/releases/VERSION` (e.g. `/releases/{{page.version}}`) carries the all releases and updates of Foreman and its dependencies.
* `/plugins` or `/plugins/VERSION` (e.g. `/plugins/{{page.version}}`) carries the all plugin releases.

Under each repo are directories for each distribution, then each architecture.

### Release packages

To set up the repository, foreman-release packages are provided which add a repo definition to `/etc/yum.repos.d`. Install the release RPM and enable the module:

    # EL8
    dnf -y install https://yum.theforeman.org/releases/{{page.version}}/el8/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm
    dnf -y module enable foreman:el8
    
    # EL9
    dnf -y install https://yum.theforeman.org/releases/{{page.version}}/el9/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm

### Signing

Release and release candidate packages are signed by the per-release key listed on [Security](security.html#GPGkeys).  Nightly packages are not signed.
