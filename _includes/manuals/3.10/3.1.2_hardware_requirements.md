The hardware requirements for Foreman depend primarily on the number of requests that it will receive, which depends on the number of configuration management clients, web UI activity and other systems using the API.

The default installation when including Puppet server will require:

* 4GB memory
* 2GB disk space

For a bare minimum installation with few clients and no Puppet server, the requirements are:

* 2GB memory
* 1GB disk space

#### Scaling notes

* The default Puma configuration is 2 workers with a maximum of 16 threads and a minimum of 0 threads per worker.
* When using a Puppet server, consult the requirements outlined in the [Puppet server system requirements](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/server/install_from_packages.html#system-requirements).
* Disk usage will increase as more data is stored in the database, mostly for facts and reports. See the [reports cronjob configuration](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.5.4PuppetReports) to change how they are expired.
