## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

### Upgrade warnings

#### Running Foreman on Ubuntu 18.04 dropped

Foreman 2.5 introduced support to run on Ubuntu 20.04. Foreman 3.0 deprecated support for running on Ubuntu 18.04 and Foreman 3.1 drops it.
Users are encouraged to upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 either on Foreman 2.5 or 3.0.

Note that this is only support to run Foreman and Foreman Proxy themselves on Ubuntu 18.04. Managing Ubuntu 18.04 systems remains supported. See [the RFC](https://community.theforeman.org/t/deprecation-plans-for-foreman-on-el7-debian-10-and-ubuntu-18-04/25008) for more information.

### Deprecations

#### Running Foreman on EL7

Foreman 2.1 introduced EL8 support and Katello 4.0 (on Foreman 2.4) followed.
While it's currently undecided when EL7 support will be dropped exactly, this is an early notice given the considerable number of EL7 deployments.
For fresh installations, EL8 should considered the preferred target.
Existing installations should start thinking about a migration plan.

Note that this is only support to run Foreman and Foreman Proxy themselves on EL7. Managing EL7 systems remains supported. See [the RFC](https://community.theforeman.org/t/deprecation-plans-for-foreman-on-el7-debian-10-and-ubuntu-18-04/25008) for more information.
