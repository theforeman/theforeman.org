## Release notes for {{page.version}}

### Headline features

#### Improvements and additions to the new Host Details page:
The new Host Details page is no longer experimental, although it is still not the default one. One can change `Settings` -> `New hosts details UI` to Yes to make it the default option. There are few new tabs added on this page,

* ##### Insights tab
The recommendations are available for the hosts in the Insights tab when using RHEL with a Red Hat cloud subscription.
It is feasible to begin remediation for the suggested remedies (if any are available).

* ##### Ansible tab
It has the ability to manage Ansible roles and variables.
The recurring jobs for the host can also be scheduled from the Ansible tab.

* ##### PatternFly 4 Search tab
A contemporary search experience is provided by the new search bar. It's the beginning of an eventual transition to PatternFly 4 for many UI components in the future.

* ##### New Build button and card for BMC Power Management
New modals for a build button and BMC Power Management is available, which improves exprience of new Host Details page.

#### Descriptions for all of the provisioning templates:
Over a hundred new descriptions have been added to provisioning templates, snippets, and scripts to assist users understand particular usage and use them in an effective manner.

#### The purge:puppet task:
A new foreman-rake purge:puppet task has been added to purge Puppet data if Puppet ENC functionality is not required.

#### Cron job to clean old Audits
A new cron job has been introduced to purge the old Audits on a daily basis. The new `Saved audits interval` setting allows you to specify the number of days you want to save Audits for.

#### Provisioning snippets support Puppet 7
The provisioning snippets have been updated to setup Puppet 7 repositories, as well as configure and install packages from those repositories.

### Upgrade warnings

#### Running Foreman on Ubuntu 18.04 dropped

Foreman 2.5 introduced support to run on Ubuntu 20.04. Foreman 3.0 deprecated support for running on Ubuntu 18.04 and Foreman 3.1 drops it.
Users are encouraged to upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 either on Foreman 2.5 or 3.0.

Note that this is only support to run Foreman and Foreman Proxy themselves on Ubuntu 18.04. Managing Ubuntu 18.04 systems remains supported. See [the RFC](https://community.theforeman.org/t/deprecation-plans-for-foreman-on-el7-debian-10-and-ubuntu-18-04/25008) for more information.

### Deprecations

#### Running Foreman on EL7

Foreman 2.1 introduced EL8 support and Katello 4.0 (on Foreman 2.4) followed.
While it's currently undecided when EL7 support will be dropped exactly, this is an early notice given the considerable number of EL7 deployments.
For fresh installations, EL8 should considered the preferred target.
Existing installations should start thinking about a migration plan.

Note that this is only support to run Foreman and Foreman Proxy themselves on EL7. Managing EL7 systems remains supported. See [the RFC](https://community.theforeman.org/t/deprecation-plans-for-foreman-on-el7-debian-10-and-ubuntu-18-04/25008) for more information.
