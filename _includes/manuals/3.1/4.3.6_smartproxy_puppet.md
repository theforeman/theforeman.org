Activate the Puppet management module within the Smart Proxy instance. This module has two functions:

* Report the Puppet environments and Puppet classes with their parameters from the Puppetserver. Used when importing classes into Foreman
* Optionally trigger immediate Puppet runs on clients using one of a number of implementations

It should be activated on Puppetservers that have the environments and modules available to import data from. This works independently of the Puppet CA functionality. To use the Puppet run functionality, it also needs to configured via an implementation listed in the section below.

To enable this module, make sure these lines are present in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/puppet.yml`:

```yaml
:enabled: https
```

#### Puppet class/environment imports

<div class="alert alert-info">Parsing manifests is done by Puppet itself, which means the manifests must be valid and pass syntax checks, else they won't show up. Use <code>puppet parser validate example.pp</code> to validate the content of a manifest.</div>

To get a list of environments, classes and their parameters, the proxy queries the Puppetserver on its own API. The URL and settings used for the proxy to Puppetserver API query can be controlled with the following settings in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/puppet_proxy_puppet_api.yml`:

```yaml
# URL of the Puppet server itself for API requests
#:puppet_url: https://puppet.example.com:8140
#
# SSL certificates used to access the puppet API
#:puppet_ssl_ca: /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem
#:puppet_ssl_cert: /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/puppet.example.com.pem
#:puppet_ssl_key: /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/private_keys/puppet.example.com.pem
#
# Smart Proxy api timeout when Puppet's environment classes api is used and classes cache is disabled
#:api_timeout: 30
```

The Puppetserver has to permit these API queries. The [HOCON-formatted auth.conf style](https://docs.puppet.com/puppetserver/latest/config_file_auth.html) is at /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/conf.d/auth.conf and requires these rules:

<pre>
{
    match-request: {
        path: "/puppet/v3/environments"
        type: path
        method: get
    }
    allow: "*"
    sort-order: 500
    name: "puppetlabs environments"
},
{
    match-request: {
    path: "/puppet/v3/environment_classes"
       type: path
       method: get
    }
    allow: "*"
    sort-order: 500
    name: "puppetlabs environment classes"
},
</pre>
