As the FreeBSD installer itself does not support a kickstart-like pulling of a response file, a custom mfsBSD image with zfsinstall is used. Prebuilt images are available [for download](http://downloads.theforeman.org/FreeBSD/) to be placed into the boot directory of your TFTP server.

However, these images can also be built from scratch as described below:

##### Building an installer image

This is an example how to build an image for FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE. For other releases, simply replace the version accordingly.

    # fetch the necessary FreeBSD components
    mkdir /tmp/basefiles
    cd /tmp/basefiles
    fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/10.2-RELEASE/base.txz
    fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/10.2-RELEASE/kernel.txz

    # clone the git repository
    git clone https://github.com/theforeman/mfsbsd.git
    cd mfsbsd

    # build the image (you need to be root for this to succeed)
    make BASE=/tmp/basefiles RELEASE=10.2-RELEASE ARCH=amd64

    # copy the image into the TFTP server directory
    cp mfsbsd-10.2-RELEASE-amd64.img /tftpboot/boot/FreeBSD-x86_64-10.2-mfs.img
