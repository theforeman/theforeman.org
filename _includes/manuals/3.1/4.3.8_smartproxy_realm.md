Activate the realm management module within the Smart Proxy instance.  This manages Kerberos realms or domains, allowing Foreman to add and remove hosts to enable them to join the realm/domain automatically during provisioning.

<pre>
:enabled: https
:use_provider: realm_freeipa
</pre>

Builtin providers are:

* `realm_freeipa` -  host object management in FreeIPA

The configuration for each provider should be in its respective file, i.e: `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/realm_freeipa.yml`.

The following settings control authentication of the proxy to the realm for management of hosts.
In `realm_freeipa.yml`:
<pre>
# Authentication for Kerberos-based Realms
:keytab_path: /etc/foreman-proxy/freeipa.keytab
:principal: realm-proxy@EXAMPLE.COM
</pre>
