## Security process

We take security issues seriously and welcome responsible disclosure from researchers discovering vulnerabilities in Foreman.  Please email [foreman-security@googlegroups.com](mailto:foreman-security@googlegroups.com) (a private address for the security team) with all reports. If you notice the security issue is related to a particular plugin, please mention the plugin within the body of the email to help us in routing the issue to the most authoritative source.

We will endeavour to resolve high severity issues in the current stable release and lower severity issues in the next major release.  Announcements of security issues will be made on [foreman-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/foreman-announce) when a release containing a fix is available to end users and credit will be given to the researcher if desired.

The policy of the project is to treat all newly reported issues as private, and after evaluation, low to medium severity issues will be made public while high severity issues will be fixed under an embargo.  Typically the project supports only one major (x.y) release at a time, though high severity issues may also be fixed in the previous release if it was only recently superseded.

This issue was reported by Sanket Jagtap.

* Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher.
* Fix released with Foreman 1.16.0
* Redmine issue [#20963](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/20963)

#### <a id="2017-7505"></a>CVE-2017-7505: User scoped in organization with permissions for user management can manage administrators that are not assigned to any organization

User with *_users permissions who is assigned to some organization(s) can do all operations granted by these permissions on all administrator user objects. We considered admin to effectively be present in all organizations.

The issue was reported by David Caplan.

* Affects Foreman 1.5 and higher
* Fix released with Foreman 1.15.1
* Redmine issue [#19612](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/19612)

#### <a id="2017-2672"></a>CVE-2017-2672: audit log stores plain text compute resource image passwords

Compute resource images added/registered in Foreman with username and password credentials will have the password stored in plain text in the audit log. A user with permission to view the audit log can view the password and may gain access to newly provisioned hosts.

This issue was reported by Daniel Kimsey.

* Affects Foreman 1.4 and higher
* Fix released with Foreman 1.15.0-RC2
* Redmine issue [#19169](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/19169)

#### <a id="2017-2667"></a>CVE-2017-2667: Hammer CLI does not verify server SSL certificate

HTTPS connections initiated by Hammer CLI to the API server do not perform validation of the server SSL/TLS certificate, allowing for a man-in-the-middle attack against the user.

This issue was reported by Tomas Strachota.

* Affects all versions of Hammer CLI
* Fix released in Hammer CLI 0.10.0 (with Foreman 1.15.0)
* Redmine issue [#19033](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/19033)

#### <a id="2016-9593"></a>CVE-2016-9593: foreman-debug collects sensitive data

It was found that foreman-debug did not obfuscate sensitive information (such as passwords, answer and configuration options) from the foreman-installer log file, allowing a user authorized to access the archives created by foreman-debug to gain access to potentially sensitive information.

This issue was reported by Pavel Moravec.

* Affects Foreman 1.2.0 up to and including 1.14.x
* Fix released with Foreman 1.15.0-RC1
* Redmine issue [#17005](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/17005)

#### <a id="2016-8639"></a>CVE-2016-8639: settings dropdown menus may run stored XSS in org/location name

If an organization or location is created with a name containing HTML, then the administrator-only Settings page will render the HTML as part of a dropdown menu.

This may permit a stored XSS attack if an organization/location with HTML in the name is created, then an administrator attempts to change the default organization/location settings.

_Mitigation:_ restrict permissions to organization and location creation, use the API or CLI instead to change the default organization/location settings.

_Note:_ this CVE identifier has been assigned retrospectively, to describe a vulnerability that was fixed during a refactoring of the affected code.

This issue was reported by Sanket Jagtap.

* Affects Foreman 1.11.0 to 1.12.4
* Fix released in Foreman 1.13.0
* Redmine issue [#15037](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/15037)

#### <a id="2016-8634"></a>CVE-2016-8634: organizations/locations wizard may run stored XSS in name

When creating an organization or location in Foreman, if the name contains HTML then the second step of the wizard will render the HTML. This occurs in the alert box on the page.

This may permit a stored XSS attack if an organization/location with HTML in the name is created, then a user is linked directly to this URL.

_Mitigation:_ restrict permissions to organization and location creation, don't follow untrusted links to Foreman.

This issue was reported by Sanket Jagtap.

* Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.14.0-RC1
* Redmine issue [#17195](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/17195)

#### <a id="2016-7078"></a>CVE-2016-7078: user with no organizations or locations can see all resources

A user account that is associated to no organizations or locations is able to view resources from all organizations/locations in the web UI or API, when either the organization or location feature is enabled. The user remains subject to permissions and filters on their assigned roles.

_Mitigation:_ ensure all users are assigned to at least one organization or location, or disable the feature if unused.

This issue was reported by Daniel Lobato Garcia.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.15.0-RC1
* Redmine issue [#16982](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/16982)

#### <a id="2016-7077"></a>CVE-2016-7077: information disclosure from association lists shown without authorization

Lists of associated resources, such as operating systems associated to a new architecture, are not restricted to listing resources that the user is authorized to view, when rendering with fewer than six items. The list will show all possible associated resources, disclosing their names.

This issue was reported by Jitendra Yejare.

* Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher, but was first mitigated against in Foreman 1.9.0 for some cases
* Fix released in Foreman 1.14.0-RC1
* Redmine issue [#16971](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/16971)

#### <a id="2016-6320"></a>CVE-2016-6320: network interface device identifiers may contain stored XSS on host form

Network interface identifiers stored for hosts may contain HTML or JavaScript that allows a stored XSS (cross-site scripting) vulnerability when later viewing the host edit form.

This issue was reported by Sanket Jagtap.

* Affects Foreman 1.8.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.2
* Redmine issue [#16022](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/16022)

#### <a id="2016-6319"></a>CVE-2016-6319: Foreman form helpers do not escape JS when rendering label

Label parameter of all form helpers was not escaped allowing XSS (cross-site scripting). The Foreman itself did not contain exploitable code but other plugins that relied on form helpers could be vulnerable. One known vulnerable plugin is Remote Execution. All versions of this plugin are affected.

* Affects Foreman 1.6.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.2
* Redmine issue [#16024](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/16024)

#### <a id="2016-5390"></a>CVE-2016-5390: API host interfaces data not restricted by view_hosts filters

Non-admin users with the view_hosts permission containing a filter are able to access API routes beneath "hosts" such as GET /api/v2/hosts/secrethost/interfaces without the filter being taken into account. This allows users to access network interface details (including BMC login details) for any host.

The filter is only correctly used when accessing the main host details (/api/v2/hosts/secrethost). Access to the "nested" routes, which includes interfaces, reports, parameters, audits, facts and Puppet classes, is not authorized beyond requiring any view_hosts permission.

* Affects Foreman 1.10.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.1 and 1.11.4
* Redmine issue [#15653](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/15653)

#### <a id="2016-4995"></a>CVE-2016-4995: information disclosure through unauthorized template previews

Users who are logged in with permissions to view some hosts are able to preview provisioning templates for any host by specifying its hostname in the URL, as the specific view_hosts permissions and filters aren't checked.

If the organization or location features are enabled, the user will still be restricted to their associated orgs/locs.

* Affects Foreman 1.11.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.1 and 1.11.4
* Redmine issue [#15490](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/15490)

#### <a id="2016-4475"></a>CVE-2016-4475: Privilege escalation in Organization and Locations API and UI

When accessing Foreman as a user limited to specific organization or location, these are not taken into account in the API or parts of the UI. This allows a user to view, edit and delete organizations and locations they are not associated with if they have the requisite permissions.

*Mitigation:* make sure you have filters restricted to organizations or locations when you limit user by assigning them to particular organizations or locations.

* Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.0-RC3 and 1.11.4
* Redmine issue [#15268](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/15268)

#### <a id="2016-4451"></a>CVE-2016-4451: Privilege escalation through Organization and Locations API

When accessing Foreman as a user limited to specific organization, if users know other organization id and have unlimited filters they can access/modify other organization data. They just have to set the id as API parameter.

*Mitigation:* make sure you have filters restricted to organizations or locations when you limit user by assigning him particular organization or location.

* Affects Foreman 1.7 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.0-RC1 and 1.11.3
* Redmine issue [#15812](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/15182)

#### <a id="2016-3728"></a>CVE-2016-3728: remote code execution in smart proxy TFTP API

The smart proxy TFTP API is vulnerable to arbitrary remote code execution, as it passes untrusted user input (the PXE template type) to the eval() function causing it to be executed.

Thanks to Lukas Zapletal for reporting the issue.

*Mitigation:* ensure `trusted_hosts` is set in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml`, HTTPS is in use and `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/tftp.yml` is configured for `https` only (if enabled).

* Affects Foreman 0.2 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.11.2 and 1.10.4
* Redmine issue [#14931](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/14931)

#### <a id="2016-3693"></a>CVE-2016-3693: application information leakage through templates

A provisioning template containing `inspect` will expose sensitive information about the Rails controller and application when rendered when using Safemode rendering (the default setting). This includes the application secret token, possibly permitting a privilege escalation.

Thanks to Ivan Necas for reporting the issue.

As a precaution, the security token may be regenerated with:

1. `chown foreman /usr/share/foreman/config/initializers/local_secret_token.rb`
1. `foreman-rake security:generate_token`
1. `chown root /usr/share/foreman/config/initializers/local_secret_token.rb`

*Mitigation:* remove edit_provisioning_templates from untrusted users.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.11.1
* Redmine issue [#14635](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/14635)

#### <a id="2016-discovery-settings"></a>Ruby code execution via Discovery settings

It is possible to run arbitrary Ruby code entering it on the Administer -
Settings - Discovery and then visiting a discovered host detail page where it
gets rendered.

* Affects Foreman Discovery 4.2.0 to 5.0.1 (gem releases only, rc and nightly builds)
* Discovery plugin 4.1 series (shipped with Foreman 1.10) was *not* affected.
* Fixed in Discovery plugin 5.0.2
* Redmine issue [#14140](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/14140)

#### <a id="2016-2100"></a>CVE-2016-2100: private bookmarks can be viewed and edited

Bookmarks set to 'private' can be viewed by any user, and edited or deleted by any user granted the edit or destroy_bookmarks permissions.

*Mitigation:* remove edit_bookmarks and destroy_bookmarks from untrusted users, remove private information from bookmark searches.

* Affects Foreman 0.3 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.11.0-RC2 and 1.10.3
* Redmine issue [#13828](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/13828)

#### <a id="2015-7518"></a>CVE-2015-7518: parameter information popup allows stored XSS

The popup boxes next to global parameters, smart class parameters and smart variables on the host and host group edit forms can allow stored XSS to be executed in the browser from the parameter description etc.

*Mitigation:* do not click on the information popup box next to parameters in the host/group forms, and/or remove permission to edit Puppet classes from untrusted users.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.10.0
* Redmine issue [#12611](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/12611)

#### <a id="2015-facts-sql"></a>SQL injection via facts search terms

The search for facts and also hosts by facts is vulnerable to SQL injection by breaking out of quotes in either the fact name or the fact value.

No CVE identifier will be assigned to this vulnerability as it affects only release candidates.

* Affects Foreman 1.10.0-RC1 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.10.0-RC3
* Redmine issue [#12458](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/12458)

#### <a id="2015-5282"></a>CVE-2015-5282: parameter hide checkbox allows stored XSS during change

The parameter management UI has a checkbox to mark values as hidden to mask them from casual viewing. The checkbox that hides/shows the value fails to handle HTML properly and so is vulnerable to an XSS issue where HTML can be stored in a parameter, and executed by another user if they later tick/untick the hide box.

* Affects Foreman 1.7.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.10.0-RC1
* Redmine issue [#11859](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11859)

#### <a id="2015-5246"></a>CVE-2015-5246: Active Directory login works with old password after change

*This CVE identifier was assigned before realizing that this was not a bug in Foreman, but a feature of Active Directory.  It will remain assigned for future reference only.  See [the Active Directory password changes](/manuals/latest/index.html#4.1.1LDAPAuthentication) section of the manual or [Microsoft KB906305](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/906305) for more details.*

When using an Active Directory instance to log into Foreman (via an LDAP authentication source), it is possible to log into Foreman for up to one hour after a password change in AD using the old password.

* Fix to Foreman not required, reconfigure Active Directory
* Redmine issue [#11471](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11471)

#### <a id="2015-5233"></a>CVE-2015-5233: reports show/destroy not restricted by host authorization

Users with view_reports or destroy_reports permissions allows a user to view or delete reports from any host without taking their view_hosts permission into account.

The reports list and other views combine the reports and hosts permissions to only show reports for hosts that a user can view, but the individual report show/delete pages and APIs do not apply the hosts permissions.

*Mitigation:* remove view_reports and destroy_reports permissions from users until a fix is available, or add a search query to the role filter to restrict it.

* Affects Foreman 1.5.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.9.1 and 1.8.4
* Redmine issue [#11579](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11579)

#### <a id="2015-5152"></a>CVE-2015-5152: require_ssl does not enforce HTTPS on API

The "require_ssl" setting in /etc/foreman/settings.yml should enforce that web requests sent to Foreman over HTTP are redirected to HTTPS, but this was found not to happen with API requests (e.g. from Hammer CLI). Foreman will process API requests over HTTP, but should have redirected.

Redirection won't help with credentials having already been sent, but should give some notification that the user/app is using the wrong URL.

*Mitigation:* add the following to the Apache HTTP VirtualHost, e.g. in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/05-foreman.d/api_request.conf`:

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/api/(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/api/$1 [R,L]

* Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.9.0-RC1
* Redmine issue [#11119](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11119)

#### <a id="2015-3235"></a>CVE-2015-3235: edit_users permission allows changing of admin passwords

A user with the edit_users permission (e.g. with the Manager role) is allowed to edit admin users. This allows them to change the password of the admin user's account and gain access to it.

*Mitigation:* change roles of users with the edit_users permission, remove the *Unlimited* flag and set a search query of `admin = false`.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.9.0-RC1
* Redmine issue [#10829](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/10829)

#### <a id="2015-3199"></a>CVE-2015-3199: Discovery: auto provision rule not enforcing org/locations

*This CVE identifier was assigned before realizing that no released versions of Foreman Discovery were affected.  It will remain assigned for future reference only.*

The Foreman Discovery plugin auto provisioning rules do not enforce that the rule and the assigned host group are in the same organization and location.  This can allow a rule to be configured with mismatched orgs/locations, and for another user who has access to the rule but not the host group, to run it and provision a host into a group in a different org/location to their own.

* Affects no released versions of Foreman Discovery
* Fix released in Foreman Discovery 4.0.0
* Redmine issue [#10469](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/10469)

#### <a id="2015-3155"></a>CVE-2015-3155: session cookie set without secure flag on HTTPS

The session cookie created when accessing the Foreman web UI over HTTPS is not set with the 'secure' flag, which may lead to session hijacking.

If a user successfully logs into Foreman, then accesses Foreman over HTTP (which redirects to HTTPS, but with a window of opportunity), the session ID will be sent unencrypted and the session may be hijacked by an attacker.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.8.1
* Redmine issue [#10275](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/10275)

#### <a id="2015-1844"></a>CVE-2015-1844: users are not restricted to organizations/locations

When a non-admin user is associated to organizations or locations, their access is not correctly restricted.  API access allows access to resources in any org/location, and UI access when the user is associated to more than one org/location is not restricted.

This allows users to read, edit and perform actions on resources (e.g. hosts) outside of the organizations or locations they have been assigned to.

* Affects Foreman 1.2.0 (TBC) and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.8.0-RC3 and 1.7.5
* Redmine issue [#9947](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/9947)

#### <a id="2015-1816"></a>CVE-2015-1816: SSL certificate not verified on LDAP connections

When making an SSL connection to an LDAP authentication source in Foreman, the remote server certificate is accepted without any verification against known certificate authorities.

This can allow the LDAP connection between Foreman and the LDAP server to be attacked, and a different LDAP server could be contacted to authenticate users to Foreman.

#### <a id="2014-3691"></a>CVE-2014-3691: SSL certificate verification bypass in smart proxy

The smart proxy (foreman-proxy) fails to block connections when no client SSL certificate is supplied, instead permitting any request.  Typically the smart proxy is configured to receive HTTPS requests with a client SSL certificate that is signed by the same CA (certificate authority) as its own, preventing unauthorized access to manage services such as DHCP, DNS and the Puppet CA.

It is strongly recommended to mitigate the problem by restricting access to the smart proxy.  More information on [foreman-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foreman-announce/jXC5ixybjqo).

Thanks to Michael Moll, Jon McKenzie and Michael Messmore for reporting the issue.

## GPG keys

The Foreman project uses multiple GPG keys to sign packages and release artifacts.  All stable releases will be signed by one of the keys.  Nightly and plugin Debian packages will be signed, while nightly and plugin RPM packages will not (this may change in the future).

Signing for the Debian family of operating systems is via secure apt and more information, including verification steps can be found [on the Debian web site](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt#Debian_archive_key_expiry).  RPMs themselves are signed and can be verified using `rpm --checksig PACKAGE`.  All yum repository configs set up by foreman-release RPMs or the installer will enable GPG checking by default.

Key management is changing at the time of writing to cycle nightly keys every two years, and issue limited duration keys per stable release.

### Key changes in July 2014

In July 2014 after a server was compromised, the existing GPG key (0xE775FF07) was revoked and replaced with a new key (0x1AA043B8) as a precaution.  All existing packages were re-signed with the new key and thereafter, new major releases are signed with new per-release keys.

All users with the old key trusted are urged to immediately disable this as follows:

* Debian users must run `sudo apt-key del E775FF07`
* RPM users must run `sudo rpm -e gpg-pubkey-e775ff07-4cda3cf9`
