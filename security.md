## Security process

We take security issues seriously and welcome responsible disclosure from researchers discovering vulnerabilities in Foreman.  Please email [foreman-security@googlegroups.com](mailto:foreman-security@googlegroups.com) (a private address for the security team) with all reports.

We will endeavour to resolve high severity issues in the current stable release and lower severity issues in the next major release.  Announcements of security issues will be made on [foreman-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/foreman-announce) when a release containing a fix is available to end users and credit will be given to the researcher if desired.

### Disclosure details

#### <a id="2014-0208"></a>CVE-2014-0208: stored cross site scripting (XSS) in search auto-completion

The search auto-completion was vulnerable to a stored cross site scripting (XSS) attack via completion of (global/host) parameters in search keys.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.4.4 and 1.5.0
* Redmine issue [#5471](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/5471)
* Red Hat Bugzilla [#1094642](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-0208)

#### <a id="2014-0192"></a>CVE-2014-0192: provisioning template previews are world-readable

Provisioning templates previews ("spoof") are accessible without authentication when used with the hostname parameter.

* Affects Foreman 1.4.0 to 1.4.3 inclusive
* Fix released in Foreman 1.4.4 and 1.5.0
* Redmine issue [#5436](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/5436)
* Red Hat Bugzilla [#1092354](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-0192)

#### <a id="2014-0135"></a>CVE-2014-0135: Kafo leaves world-readable default_values.yaml file

When Kafo (used in the Foreman installer) runs, a /tmp/default_values.yaml file is written to and created with world readable permissions.  This is prone to race-condition attacks and contains default values for all parameters, such as autogenerated passwords.

* Affects all known Kafo versions
* Fix released in Kafo 0.3.17 and 0.5.2 (to Foreman 1.4 and 1.5 repos respectively)
* Redmine issue [#4648](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/4648)
* Red Hat Bugzilla [#1076335](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-0135)

#### <a id="2014-0090"></a>CVE-2014-0090: session fixation, new session IDs are not generated on login

Upon successful login, a new session ID was not generated for the user, so an attacker who had set the session ID in the request from the user's browser would be able to exploit the escalated session with the user's privileges.

Thanks to Jeremy Choi and Keqin Hong of the Red Hat HSS Pen-Test Team for discovering this issue.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.4.2
* Redmine issue [#4457](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/4457)
* Red Hat Bugzilla [#1072151](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-0090)

#### <a id="2014-0089"></a>CVE-2014-0089: stored cross site scripting (XSS) on 500 error page

The 500 error page was vulnerable to stored cross site scripting attacks, where the error message was rendered without HTML encoding.  In addition, bookmarks could be saved by any user with HTML in the name which caused an error when rendering the bookmark list, leading to a 500 error and execution of the HTML in the browser.

Thanks to Jeremy Choi and Keqin Hong of the Red Hat HSS Pen-Test Team for discovering this issue.

* Affects Foreman 1.4.0 to 1.4.1 inclusive
* Fix released in Foreman 1.4.2

#### <a id="2013-0210"></a>CVE-2013-0210: Arbitrary command execution risk in smart proxy

Requests to the smart proxy Puppet run API were not properly escaped when running the Puppet command, leading to possible arbitrary command execution.

* Fix released in Foreman 1.2.0

#### <a id="2013-0187"></a>CVE-2013-0187: XMLHttpRequest bypasses authorization

#### <a id="2013-0174"></a>CVE-2013-0174: exposed hashed root passwords can be retrieved by unauthenticated remote users

The external node classifier (ENC) API in Foreman was accessible to any remote host and the output would contain the hashed root psasword (used for unattended installation).  Authentication and authorization features were added to the ENC API to secure this data.

Thanks to Andreas Rogge for discovering this issue.

* Fix released in Foreman 1.0.2

#### <a id="2012-5477"></a>CVE-2012-5477: world writable files in smart proxy

The smart proxy daemon ran with a umask of 0, causing files and directories written by it to have world-writable bits set.  Files managed by the smart proxy could be modified by local users on the same host.
