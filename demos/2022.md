# Community Demos (2022)
------------------------------

Every few weeks we host a Community Demo to showcase new & interesting developments from the Foreman
community.
We encourage participation from any member of the community (although you do need a
Google account), so if youâ€™ve been working on something cool, please do come show it off.
If you'd like to watch the community demo, they're usually on a Thursday and we always list them in
advance on our [Community Events Calendar](https://community.theforeman.org/c/events/l/calendar).

Here is a list of every demo that has taken place this year.
Our demos are split into two sections: a user-focused section and a developer-focused section.

If you've any questions or feedback, we welcome any feedback in our
[community](https://community.theforeman.org)
