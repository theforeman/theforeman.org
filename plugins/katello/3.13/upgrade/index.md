# Katello Upgrade

Katello supports upgrades from version 2.0.  For users transitioning from 1.4, please see - [Transition Guide](/plugins/katello/{{ page.version }}/installation/2.0-transition.html).


# Pre-upgrade considerations

Before you upgrade, you need to run the upgrade check script that will check for any active tasks, your version of Katello, and if there are any content hosts that will be deleted (see below). This script is included in Katello 2.4.3.

To run the script:

{% highlight bash %}
foreman-rake katello:upgrade_check
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 1 - Backup

If Katello is running on a Virtual Machine, we recommend to take a snapshot prior to upgrading. Otherwise, take a backup of the relevant databases by following the [instructions here](/plugins/katello/{{ page.version }}/user_guide/backup/).

## Step 2 - Operating System

Ensure your operating system is fully up-to-date:

{% highlight bash %}
yum -y update
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 3 - Repositories

Update the Foreman and Katello release packages:

  * RHEL7 / CentOS 7:

{% highlight bash %}
  yum update -y https://fedorapeople.org/groups/katello/releases/yum/{{ page.version }}/katello/el7/x86_64/katello-repos-latest.rpm
  yum update -y https://yum.theforeman.org/releases/{{ page.foreman_version }}/el7/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm
  yum update -y foreman-release-scl
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 4 - Update Packages

Clean the yum cache

{% highlight bash %}
yum clean all
{% endhighlight %}

Update the required packages:

{% highlight bash %}
yum -y update
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 5 - Run Installer

The installer with the --upgrade flag will run the right database migrations for all component services, as well as adjusting the configuration to reflect what's new in Katello {{ page.version }}

{% highlight bash %}
foreman-installer --scenario katello --upgrade
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 6 - Reboot if necessary
If kernel packages are updated during Step 2 (e.g. upgrading el 6.6 to 6.7), you must reboot and ensure the new kernel and SELinux policy are loaded. If there are no kernel or selinux updates
then this step can be omitted.

## Congratulations!
You have now successfully upgraded your Katello to {% if page.version %}{{ page.version }} For a rundown of what was added, please see [release notes](/plugins/katello/{{ page.version }}/release_notes/release_notes.html).{% else %}the latest 3.13{% endif %}!**

If for any reason, the above steps failed, please review /var/log/foreman-installer/katello.log -- if any of the "Upgrade step" tasks failed, you may try to run them manaully below to aid in troubleshooting.
