# Content Search

Content Search provides a mechanism to search, compare, and contrast content across Lifecycle Environments.  The types of content include:

 * Content Views
 * Products
 * Repositories
 * Packages
 * Errata
 * Puppet Modules

## Definitions

 * Lifecycle Environment - A container for content view versions which are consumed by content hosts.
 * Content View - A definition of content that combines products, packages, errata and Puppet modules, with capabilities for intelligent filtering and snapshotting. Content Views are a refinement of the combination of channels and cloning from Spacewalk.
 * Product - A collection of content repositories.
 * Repository - A collection of content (yum repository, puppet repository).
 * Package - An RPM
 * Erratum - A set of changes consisting of an enhancement, bug or security fix
 * Puppet Module - A Puppet Module is a set of Puppet manifests/classes, template files, tests and other components packaged together in a specific directory format. Puppet Modules are typically associated with specific software (eg: NTP, Apache, etc) and contain various classes used to assist in the installation and configuration of that software. Puppet Labs maintains a repository of official and user-contributed modules called the Puppet Forge.

## General Workflow

Below is a general workflow for Content Search.

1. [Select Lifecycle Environments](/plugins/katello/{{ page.version }}/user_guide/content_search/index.html#select-lifecycle-environments)
2. [Search Packages - Basic](/plugins/katello/{{ page.version }}/user_guide/content_search/index.html#search-packages---basic)
3. [Search Packages - Advanced](/plugins/katello/{{ page.version }}/user_guide/content_search/index.html#search-packages---advanced)
4. [View Package details](/plugins/katello/{{ page.version }}/user_guide/content_search/index.html#view-package-details)
5. [Compare Repositories](/plugins/katello/{{ page.version }}/user_guide/content_search/index.html#compare-repositories)

Note: Although Packages are chosen in steps 2-4 of in the workflow above, actions may also be performed on Content Views, Products, Repositories, Errata, and Puppet Modules.

## Select Lifecycle Environments

When performing Content Search actions, the default behavior is to search for content in the Library Lifecycle Environment; however, in many cases, it is desirable to perform actions using other Lifecycle Environments.

To select Lifecycle Environments:

 * navigate to: Content > Content Search
 * hover over the **+** icon, located on the right side of the page, to display the available Lifecycle Environments
 * hover over the desired Lifecycle Environment and click the checkbox displayed next to it

View available Lifecycle Environments:

## Search Packages - Basic

To search packages:

 * perform the following actions from the search widget located on the left side of the page:
   * select Content > Packages
   * click **Search** or **Refresh Results**
 * click on the **>** located to the left of a Product name (e.g. "Red Hat Enterprise Linux") to view the list of repositories in that product
 * click on the **>** located to the left of a Repository name (e.g. "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Server RPMs x86_64 6Server")

Note: the above will search for all packages across all Content Views, Products and Repositories for the selected Lifecycle Environments.

## Search Packages - Advanced

[Search Packages - Basic](/plugins/katello/{{ page.version }}/user_guide/content_search/index.html#search-packages---basic) illustrates how to search for all packages across all Content Views, Products and Repositories, for the selected Lifecycle Environments; however, it is possible to refine the search using the input fields provided within the search widget.

The following is an example search for all kernel packages within a specific Content View:

 * perform the following actions from the search widget located on the left side of the page:
   * select Content > Packages
   * in the Content View input box, begin entering the name of a Content View (e.g. "RHEL")
   * select one of the Content Views displayed (e.g. "RHEL 6 Security Only")
   * click **Add**
   * in the Packages input box, enter "kernel*"
     * For more details on the syntax supported for this input, hover over the **(i)** icon next to the input.
   * click **Search** or **Refresh Results**

## View Package Details

To view package details:

  * hover over a package name (e.g. "busybox") and for additional details:
    * click **View package files**
    * click **View package changelog**

## Compare Repositories

To compare multiple repositories:

 * perform the following actions from the search widget located on the left side of the page:
   * select Content > Repositories
   * click **Search** or **Refresh Results**
 * click on the **>** located to the left of the desired Product names (e.g. "Red Hat Enterprise Linux") to view the list of repositories in those products
 * click on the checkboxes next to the repositories to compare
 * click **Compare Selected**

Search Results and Select Products:

Select Repositories to Compare:
![Select Repositories to Compare](/plugins/katello/{{ page.version }}/user_guide/lifecycle_environments/compare_repositories_select_repositories.png)

Comparison Results:

  * A darkened circle indicates that the errata exists in the associated repository and a hyphen (**-**) indicates that it does not.
  * The image below illustrates a Union comparison for Errata; however, multiple options are available when comparing content.  For example,
    * Show:
      * Errata
      * Packages
      * Puppet Modules
    * View:
      * Union: Show all results regardless of which columns they exist in.
      * Intersection: Show only results that exist in all selected columns.
      * Difference: Show only results that do not exist in all selected columns.
  * In addition, hovering over an Errata ID (e.g. RHBA-2014:1056), Package name (e.g. "busybox") or Puppet Module name (e.g. "httpd") will provide more details on the object, similar to what is shown in [View Package Details](/plugins/katello/{{ page.version }}/user_guide/content_search/index.html#view-package-details)
