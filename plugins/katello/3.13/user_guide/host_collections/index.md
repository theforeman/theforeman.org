# Managing Content Hosts using Host Collections

Host Collections provide a mechanism to statically group multiple Content Hosts.  This enables administrators to group Content Hosts based on the needs of their organization.  For example, Content Hosts could be grouped by function, department or business unit.

Once a Host Collection is created, it can be used to perform various actions on the Content Hosts contained within it.  This includes actions such as the following:

- Package installation, removal and update
- Errata installation
- Changing of assigned Lifecycle Environment or Content View
