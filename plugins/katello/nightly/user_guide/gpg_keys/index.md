# Managing Content Hosts using GPG Keys

GPG Keys provide a way to verify the integrity of packages found within a Repository and/or Product.
Once one or more GPG Keys have been created, they can be associated with a Product or Repository during creation or by editing an existing Product or Repository.  
 
For more information on GPG Keys see [The GNU Privacy Guard](https://www.gnupg.org/).

## Associate GPG Key with Product

To add a GPG to a Product:

Note that adding a GPG Key to a Product adds the GPG Key to all current and future repositories unless a repository already has a GPG Key assigned.
This can also be overriden by assignming a GPG Key to an individual repository afterward as well. 

- navigate to: Content > Products
- select the desired Product from the list
- click **Details**
- click the edit button on the GPG Key field
- select the desired GPG Key
