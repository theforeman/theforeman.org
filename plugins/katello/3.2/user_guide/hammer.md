# Hammer

Hammer provides a command-line-interface (CLI) for performing
tasks in Katello. It provides an alternative to the web interface where
commands can be run from the command line or used in shell scripts.

## Installation

The Hammer package is installed as part of Katello. Alternatively, Hammer
can be installed and run from a remote system as long as it can connect to
Katello via HTTP or HTTPS.

### Remote install

Install the prerequisite repositories [as per our installation guide](/plugins/katello/{{ site.version }}/installation/index.html).

Now install the hammer-cli-katello package:

```
yum -y install rubygem-hammer_cli_katello
```

## Setup

In order to use hammer, we have to configure it to point to the Katello server.

Edit `/etc/hammer/cli.modules.d/foreman.yml` and make sure the :host: points to
your server. You can also set your username and password in this file. Suppose
your server is at `localhost:80` and your credentials are admin/changeme, your
foreman.yml file would contain:

```yaml
:foreman:
  :enable_module: true
  :host: 'http://localhost:80/'
  :username: 'admin'
  :password: 'changeme'
```

Login information can also be passed with each command (see the **Usage**
section) in which case you can omit them from this file.

Also, settings can be overriden on per user basis by creating a `~/.hammer`
directory and placing override files in there. Suppose you wanted to override
`foreman.yml`, then you'd create and update `~/.hammer/cli.modules.d/foreman.yml`.

And then finally test out your installation:

```bash
hammer -vh
```

## Usage

To use Hammer, simply run the `hammer` command. If run without any commands
or options, the `hammer` command will show a list of subcommands.

```

To run a command, just pass any relavant options.

```

If you aren't storing your login name and password in your hammer config file,
you'll need to pass those in as well.

```

```
