version: 0.3

# 1. {{ page.title }}

This plugin enables Foreman to run arbitrary commands on hosts using different
providers. Initially only an SSH provider is supported but we plan to add more.
Communication goes through the smart proxy so Foreman does not have to have
direct access to the target host and can scale to control many hosts. A command
can be customized similarly to provisioning templates or partition tables. A
number of templates are included for running basic commands, installing
packages, etc. For more details see the [Job
Templates](plugins/foreman_remote_execution/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.1JobTemplates)
section.

Below is a short demo of running a single command on a particular host, with
the ability to view the output live:

![GIF Demo](/plugins/foreman_remote_execution/{{page.version}}/remote_execution.gif)

The command can be executed on multiple servers at once while specific parts of
it can vary per host - in other words you can use variables in your commands.
Variable values can be filled by given host fact, smart class parameter, smart
variable or even host parameter. Last but not least, like the "command" example
above, the value can be specified by user when they trigger the execution.

A few examples of tasks that this plugin helps you achieve:

- Install/update/remove a package
- Bootstrap a configuration management agent
- Trigger a Puppet/Salt/Chef run

## 1.1 Components

The whole remote execution system is pluggable, making it easy to add more
providers of communication later. Therefore it's split into several components
that must be installed on Foreman and the Smart Proxy.

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Plugin</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>foreman_remote_execution</td>
    <td>Required, contains the UI part and currently also SSH provider, depends on foreman-tasks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>foreman_tasks</td>
    <td>Required, keep status of all executed commands, allows debugging if something goes wrong</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>smart_proxy_remote_execution_ssh</td>
    <td>Smart Proxy plugin, required for using SSH provider, proxies the communication between Foreman and hosts, requires smart_proxy_dynflow</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>smart_proxy_dynflow</td>
    <td>Smart Proxy plugin, runs the jobs asynchronously and keeps status of commands executed via this proxy. This plugins uses relational SQL DB (sqlite).</td>
  </tr>
</table>


## 1.2 Compatability

Each component is packaged for platforms that Foreman is officially packaged
for. Since both Foreman and Smart Proxy plugins requires Dynflow, Ruby 1.9+ is
required.

# 2. Installation

## 2.1 Plugin Installation

This chapter covers a clean Foreman and plugin installation. We assume the
smart proxy will be installed on the same host, however it's not a requirement.
Please adapt according to your needs.

Start by installing the Foreman nightly or 1.10 repository and EPEL7, see
[Quickstart instructions](/manuals/latest/index.html#2.Quickstart) and [Foreman
manual](/manuals/latest/index.html#3.InstallingForeman) for more information.

### With Foreman Installer

You can install both the Foreman and Smart Proxy plugin with the installer:

    foreman-installer --enable-foreman-plugin-remote-execution\
                      --enable-foreman-plugin-tasks\
                      --enable-foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-ssh

The installer will automatically configure an SSH key for you, or you may use an existing see.  See the foreman-installer --help for more information.

### Manual Installation

In the case you want to install the package manually on an existing Foreman or
a Katello, use the following steps.

Install the packages appropriate for your operating system:

RPM:

    yum install tfm-rubygem-foreman_remote_execution tfm-rubygem-foreman-tasks\
                rubygem-smart_proxy_remote_execution_ssh

DEB:

    apt-get install ruby-foreman-tasks ruby-foreman-remote-execution\
                    ruby-smart-proxy-remote-execution-ssh

Next you have to setup ssh keys. By default smart proxy loads the key
from `/usr/share/foreman-proxy/.ssh/id_rsa_foreman_proxy`. To customize it you
can edit the configuration in
`/etc/foreman-proxy/config/settings.d/remote_execution_ssh.yml`. Without
customization you need to create new ssh key and distribute it to
target hosts. The key must not use passphrase.

To generate a key, run following command on the host where Smart Proxy runs

    mkdir ~foreman-proxy/.ssh
    chown foreman-proxy ~foreman-proxy/.ssh
    sudo -u foreman-proxy ssh-keygen -f ~foreman-proxy/.ssh/id_rsa_foreman_proxy -N ''

When using SELinux make sure the directory and the files have correct labels
of ssh_home_t. If not, restore the context:

    restorecon -RvF ~foreman-proxy/.ssh

Don't forget to restart Foreman, Smart Proxy and Foreman tasks so
plugins are loaded

    service httpd restart
    service foreman-tasks restart
    service foreman-proxy restart

Finally, you have to refresh the Smart Proxy features in the Foreman:
Dynflow and Ssh should appear there as new features of the Smart Proxy.

## 2.2 Remote Hosts Configuration

The remote hosts need to be configured to accept the private key that the smart
proxy is using. `root` is used as the default user for accessing remote hosts
via SSH.  You may set the **remote_execution_ssh_user** global setting to change
the default.  If you would like to override at the host group, host, or
other level, you may use parameters to do so.  Set a parameter called
**remote_execution_ssh_user**.

The ssh keys for the smart proxies are available as a host parameter -
`remote_execution_ssh_keys`.  This allows you to manage the authorized keys
with your configuration management platform of choice, or through a
provisioning template.

If you prefer to use a provisioning template, an example snippet is included.
In the kickstart %post or finish template, simply include:

     <%= snippet 'remote_execution_ssh_keys' %>

If you prefer to distribute the keys manually, you may do this:

    ssh-copy-id -i ~foreman-proxy/.ssh/id_rsa_foreman_proxy.pub root@target.example.com

Alternatively, the Smart Proxy publishes the public key over the API, so that
one can just download it into authorized keys:

    curl https://myproxy.example.com:8443/ssh/pubkey >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

For the execution to work, the client needs to have **openssh-server**
installed and configured.  Also, **openssh-clients** need to be present, in
order to **scp** to work (which we use for getting
the scripts to the remote host)

# 3. Usage

After installation you can start preparing your commands and run them on your
hosts. Every command must be defined as a Job Template. Once defined it can be
executed multiple times. Let's start with the definition first.

## 3.1 Job Templates

If you're familiar with Foreman provisioning templates, you should find writing
job templates familiar. First navigate to the Host > Job Templates menu. Then
hit the green button with label "New Job Template".

Note: If you don't see a menu entry, the Foreman plugin is not installed
correctly.

Now you should see a form similar to the Provisioning template one. In first
tab you have to fill in **Name**. You can use input macros in ERB tags which
stands for variables which you define in second tab called Job.

![Job Template form](/plugins/foreman_remote_execution/{{page.version}}/job_template_form.png)

Before we get to inputs, lets look at other fields in Job tab. First one is an
autocomplete field called **Job category**. This groups job template together
and makes managing a huge number of templates easier.

A description format field is a template for job description. Imagine you run
a template named "Install package" 10 times, each time with different package
name specified by user input (more about this below). On job overview page
you'd see the same "Install package" job and you'd have to inspect provided
inputs to find the one that installed let's say httpd package. Using
description format you set your own rules for creating the description.
Input values can be used as part of it. A good description format for our
install package example would be the following:

    Install package %{package_name}

Note that the name wrapped in %{...} is the name of input which value will
replace this placeholder so you would see "Install package httpd" if httpd
was used for this input. Note that the description format can be modified
per job invocation as well so this is just a default value for particular
job template. Two extra placeholders %{template_name} and %{job_category}
can be used.

On the very same tab you can configure inputs. These template inputs
defines values that can be accessed in the template itself. To add new input,
click the green button "+ Add Input" which adds more fields to the form. To
remove the input, hit the cross in top right corner of the input form.

We support four types of inputs. Each must have it's **name** which is
used in macro. If my input has the name "motd", I can then use
following ERB tag in my template code:

    echo "<%= input('motd') -%>" > /etc/motd

The way we determine the input value differs based on **Input type**.  Let's
start with User input. This input always needs the value to be specified
by user. It means when user runs the job, we display the field that they
must fill in, or provide options to select from. The provided value will be
used as a result for the corresponding input macro. Whatever you put in
**Description** field will be displayed to the user so he knows what's the
purpose of this input.

The rest of the types load values from the host and do not require any user
interaction. Since the template is always rendered for a specific host on which
the job is executed we load the value this host data. These data can be either
Fact (coming from Puppet/Salt/Chef), smart class parameter (when you use
Foreman as Puppet ENC), smart variable or a parameter.

If you want to load value from host facts, use Fact value input type.
You'll have to specify the **Fact name** so Foreman can match the
right fact. If you make a mistake or the fact is not present for a
given host, the rendering of template will fail and hence the
execution on this host will fail.

If you want to use a value from smart class parameter, use Puppet parameter
input type. you'll have to specify puppet class name and the name of its
parameter. It's the value that you can see in ENC YAML under `classes` key.

If you want to use either smart variable or parameter, use Variable input type.
Both of these values are part of ENC YAML under `parameters` key overiding each
other if they have same name. You have to specify the name of either parameter
or smart variable.

If you're confused about the difference between smart class parameter,
smart variable and parameter, checkout Foreman manual
[parameters](http://www.theforeman.org/manuals/latest/index.html#4.2.3Parameters)
section.

It is also possible to render one job template from another:

    <%= render_template("Run Command - SSH Default", :command => "echo hello world > /etc/motd") %>

The inputs for the rendered template can be specified explicitly in the `render_template`
call, or they can be imported into the template by using a **foreign input set** concept.
It's similar to the inputs (editable in **Job tab** of edit template form).

One can provide:

- **target template** - inputs of what template should be imported
- **include all** - this imports all the inputs of target template
- **include** - if **include all** is disabled, this provides a list of comma separated names of inputs to include
- **exclude** - a list of comma separated names of inputs to exclude
    from the import - useful when overriding some inputs in the template

By default, `render_template` looks at the foreign input sets at the template
to fill in the values for a particular template. One can disable this behavior
like this:

    <%= render_template("Run Command - SSH Default", { :command => "echo hello world > /etc/motd" }, { :with_foreign_input_set => false } ) %>

You can also use `input` macro to pass the value from current template
input. Let's assume we have a template that sets hostname according to
fqdn puppet fact. It has an input of Fact value type with name fqdn.
Now we want to use it in our generic template to set any hostname that
the user specifies. We can create a foreign input set that includes
all and exclude the fqdn input, define our own input of type User
input with the same name and call the original template like this:

    <%= render_template("Set hostname", { :fqdn => input('fqdn') }) %>

Since we created a foreign input set that includes all except fqdn, if
"Set hostname" template has other inputs they would be used when
rendering the template. If there were some inputs that have to be
filled by user, they would be displayed in job invocation form of our
newly created template.

It's not allowed to import several inputs with the same name from
different templates due to conflicts it would cause and it's the
template author's responsibility to make sure the foreign inputs are
unique across the whole template.

Note that until inputs and foreign input sets are saved the preview of
template won't work. To review the template first save it and then get
back to the form and hit Preview button.

You can also specify default effective user for job template. By default a
login that's used to run the script on target host is specified by global
setting named **remote_execution_effective_user** but if you specify another
login, sudo would try to change effective user to this value. You can
also enforce using **current user** login which can be handy if your users
have same login as their posix accounts on target hosts. Last field
is **overridable** which determines whether job template settings can be
overridden during job invocation. See [settings chapter](plugins/foreman_remote_execution/{{page.version}}/index.html#4.2Globalsettings)
for more details about customization.

## 3.2 Executing a Job

To execute on one host, go to the host detail page and click green "Run Job"
button. For multiple hosts, use the bulk action tool on the "All hosts" page
to select "Run Job".

![Job Invocation form](/plugins/foreman_remote_execution/{{page.version}}/invocation_form.png)

In this form you select which Job template you want to run on selected
host(s). Then you can see prefilled **Search query** that uses the
[Foreman searching syntax](/manuals/latest/index.html#4.1.5Searching).
You can customize the query to search any set of hosts, e.g. all hosts
running CentOS 7.1 or hosts with 1 GB memory. You can check how many
hosts such search query covers by clicking refresh button below.

You can also specify **Type of query**. Currently we support two
options

- **Static query** - evaluates the search query immediately when you
    hit the Submit button and saves the resulting set as the target of
    this execution
- **Dynamic query** - stores the search query and does the evaluation
    just before the command is executed, which means if there are new
    hosts added meanwhile, the job will be executed on them as well

Dynamic query is a powerful tool when used with scheduled or recurring
executions in combinations with Bookmarks being used for specifying the
targets. You don't have to change scheduled job invocation if you just
change the query of used bookmark.

To review the list of target hosts you can use the button with eye
icon. It will display the list of hosts matching the search query.

You can override effective user for this invocation unless it was forbidden
for selected job template. In non-editable description field you can see
the name of job that will be used after you save it. You can also override
description format by unchecking **Use default description template** checkbox
and providing your own template in **Description template**. You can use
placeholders that will be replaced by values of inputs with corresponding name
for example if there's input with name service_name you can specify the
template like this

    Restart service %{service_name}

If you set the input value to "httpd" the resulting description would become
"Restart service httpd".

You can also plan the execution in future or configure multiple rerunning.
There's a second tab called **Scheduling** where you can choose from

- **Execute now** - immediate single execution,
- **Schedule future execution** - delayed single execution
- **Set up recurring execution** - multiple executions on regular basis

![Job Invocation schedule form](/plugins/foreman_remote_execution/{{page.version}}/invocation_form_scheduling.png)

While execute now is obvious, future time scheduling offers you to customize
two things. First is when the job should start, the second one called **Start
before** determines the deadline after which the execution shouldn't start.
This can be useful when you have some maintenance window and if the execution
gets delayed it wouldn't be safe to run when the window was closed.

When setting up recurring execution there are many ways how you can specify
the interval. You can choose from hourly, daily, weekly, monthly interval
basis and for advanced users there's option to specify custom cron
configuration. This way you can setup various intervals, for example

    # Run on every second Sunday of every month
    0 4 8-14 * *

    # Run every 5 minutes during 6 AM and 6 PM
    */5 6,18 * * *

You can specify the number of runs as **Repeat N times** attribute or limit
it by **Ends at** date. What happens sooner takes precedence. You can keep
the invocation configured without any fixed ending condition. If you want
to stop such job later, you either cancel the job and cancel the recurring
logic.

Another feature to allow more precise control over the execution is limitting
by concurrency level and distributing the tasks over time. The **Concurrency level**
allows to set a quota on how many parallel tasks can be run, which can effectively
prevent depleting all of the system's resources in case of executing a job
on a large number of hosts. The **Time span** can be used to define a maintenance
window, across which the tasks should be distributed. Important thing to note is
the tasks which could not be started within that window (for example tasks before
them took too long to finish) are cancelled. This allows to tailor the execution
to fit your hardware and needs.

After submitting the form, you're redirected to the Job detail which informs
you about the progress.

## 3.3 Job detail

On the Job detail page you can see overall progress and result of the job
execution.

![Job detail 1](/plugins/foreman_remote_execution/{{page.version}}/job_detail_1.png)

In the overview tab you can see what query was used to find the hosts and how
many hosts were found using it. Below is the evaluated template in generic
form. If there were some fact or parameter inputs used, you will see only
placeholders for them since they are specific to each host. User inputs are
evaluated since they are same for all hosts. A chart is showing the status of
the job on all targets.

From this screen you can even cancel the job if it's not finished yet.  First
cancel attempt will try to cancel the run on the Smart Proxy. If proxy does not
respond, you can hit the cancel button a second time which forces the Job to be
cancelled on Foreman (while it still might be running on Smart Proxy). Last Job
Task takes you to Foreman Tasks that represents this Job.

In Hosts tab you can see all hosts targeted by this execution, status
of the job on them and link to Foreman Task that represent the
execution for a particular host. Note that this task is a subtask of a
whole Job task.

If you scheduled a recurring you'll also see **Recurring logic** tab. This
gives you some basic information, e.g. when next run is supposed to happen.
After you cancel the job, it cancels all future executions as well.

## 3.4 Jobs list

You can find all Jobs when you navigate to Monitor > Jobs. A table
lists all jobs from history to future. You can search jobs by description with
a query like

    description ~ set*

This example would find all executions that run job which description starts with
"set". Similarly you can search based on job category using keyword `job_category`.

![Job invocations list](/plugins/foreman_remote_execution/{{page.version}}/job_invocations.png)

Each Job has a status which tracks the progress of the execution. A status
value can be one of

- **queued** - job invocation was saved and has not start yet, either background processor hasn't picked it yet or it was scheduled in future,
- **running** - background processor picked the job, we might have patial update but it is not finished yet,
- **succeeded** - job has finished sucessfully,
- **failed** - job has finished with some issue,

The same status is recorded for host as execution status after each job
execution that targeted it. You can search for hosts using following
search syntax

    execution_status = ok
    execution_status = error

The first example would find all hosts last job execution in state succeeded
and hosts that have no job. The second returns hosts with failed last job.

If the job has more than one target hosts, the overall status is composed
from statuses of all targets run. If execution failed on any of target the
overall result of job would be failed. Similarly it succeeds only if all
targets suceeds. Note that the status can be running if 99% targets already
finished the job since the overall job is still waiting for the rest.

A start column tells us when the task started or is planned to start if it
was scheduled to future. You can use it in search syntax as *start_at*.
There's also other similar attribute called *started_at* which holds
information about when the task was picked by background processor and started
in fact.

## 3.5 CLI

A [hammer]({{ site.baseurl }}manuals/latest/index.html#4.5CommandLineInterface)
plugin for Remote Execution is available, [follow the instructions for
installing a plugin]({{ site.baseurl }}plugins/#2.Installation) to install
hammer_cli_foreman_remote_execution, and then see `hammer --help` for more
information.

Examples:

- Create a job template:

```
hammer job-template create --file /tmp/template.txt --name "Ping a Host"\
  --provider-type SSH --job-category "Commands"
```

- Run a job:

```
hammer job-invocation create --job-template "Run Command - SSH Default" \
  --inputs command="ping -c 50 www.google.com" --search-query "name ~ rex01"
```

- Show output from a job:

```
hammer job-invocation output --id 155 --host rex01.example.com
```

# 4. Advanced topics

In this section we try to explain how things work behind the scenes.

## 4.1 Determining the smart proxy for host

In order to perform the job on a host, there needs to be a Smart Proxy
available to do the job. In the default install, it would use all Smart proxies
with a remote execution provider.  This can be turned off by changing the
global setting **remote_execution_global_proxy** to false.

In more complex environments, not all proxies can be used, due to possible
network isolation.  In this case, you may assign a pool of proxies to each
subnet, and jobs will be load balanced across them.

Alternatively, you may enable a fallback mode by setting
**remote_execution_fallback_proxy** to true.  In this case, the plugin will
consider any proxy associated with the host, such as its Puppetmaster, as long
as the proxy also has a remote execution feature.

## 4.2 Global settings

Under Administer -> Settings you can find RemoteExecution tab which allows you
to customize plugin behavior. Here is the list of settings and their meaning.

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>remote_execution_effective_user</td>
    <td>This is a login of default effective user for any job. When job is executed the effective user of the process
    is changed accordingly (e.g. by sudo). This option can be overridden per job template and job invocation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>remote_execution_effective_user_method</td>
      <td>What method should be used to set the effective user on target, currently only <b>su</b> and <b>sudo</b> are supported.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>remote_execution_fallback_proxy</td>
      <td>Search the host for any proxy with Remote Execution, useful when the host has no subnet or the subnet does not
      have an execution proxy.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>remote_execution_global_proxy</td>
      <td>Search for remote execution proxy outside of the proxies assigned to the host. If locations or organizations
      are enabled, the search will be limited to the host's organization or location.</td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>remote_execution_ssh_user</td>
      <td>Default user to use while the smart-proxy connects to the target using SSH. You may override per host by
      setting a parameter called remote_execution_ssh_user. Note that it can be set per Host, Host group,
      Operating system, Domain, Location and Organization. Also note that this can differ from effective user.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 4.3 Permission delegation

If you want to lock down ability of your users to run arbitrary scripts within
your infrastructure, you can selectively configure what they can run and on
which targets.

We provide 2 built-in roles that you can use, one is for the whole remote
execution features called **Remote Execution Manager** and the second with
the name **Remote Execution User** that allows only running jobs without
permissions to modify job templates. You can clone the role and customize
its filter for even higher granularity. If you adjust the filter with
*view_job_templates* permission, user will be able to see and trigger only
jobs based on matching job templates. The same applies on *view_hosts* and
*view_smart_proxies* if you need to limit which hosts or smart proxies users
can use.

There's extra permission called **execute_template_invocation** which is
checked just before the invocation starts allowing you to set even more
granular permissions. The filter for this permission can define which job
template can be run on particular host, let's look at some examples of such
filters:

    name = Reboot and host.name = staging.example.com
    name = Reboot and host.name ~ *.staging.example.com
    name = "Restart service" and host_group.name = webservers

Note that permissions assigned to users can change in time, especially after
users already scheduled some runs in future, therefore this permissions is
enforced just before the run resulting in execution failure.

## 4.4 Writing custom templates

During writing your own job templates you might find some of following macros
useful.

### 4.4.1 render_template

You can render a template from another template and feed it with inputs.
A short example follows

    <%= render_template 'Package Action', :action => 'install', :package => 'httpd' %>
    chkconfig httpd on
    <%= render_template 'Service Action', :action => 'start', :service_name => 'httpd' %>

For more information, see [Job
Templates](plugins/foreman_remote_execution/{{page.version}}/index.html#3.1JobTemplates)

### 4.4.2 preview?

When you need to render a different output for preview of the template, you can
user `preview?` macro. This is useful if you need to hide some sensitive or
spamming part - e.g. private or public key content.

    <% if preview? %>
      PUBLIC_KEY_STRIPPED_OUT
    <% else %>
      <%= input('public_key') %>
    <% end %>

Also when you disable safe mode, you might touch internal Foreman objects.
Imagine you have a template for deleting puppet certificate that first
deletes the certificate on puppet CA through Foreman objects and then
removes it on target host.

    <% if preview? -%>
    #   this would delete a certificate on puppet ca, but running in preview mode
    <% else -%>
      <%= @host.puppet_ca_proxy.statuses[:puppetca].destroy(@host.name) %>
    <% end -%>
    rm -rf /var/lib/puppet/ssl/*

In this case, previewing of the template would immediately trigger destroy
method and therefore it's wrapped in preview condition.

## 4.5 Plugin developer API

Plugins can leverage Remote Execution to perform a particular job on a host by
defining a Remote Execution Feature and the provided inputs. The
`provided_inputs` is a list of inputs that the feature provides to the
template.

The feature can be registered in the plugin initializer:

```
RemoteExecutionFeature.register(:reprovision, N_("Reprovision"),
                                :description => "Reprovision the host via script",
                                :provided_inputs => ["script"])
```

The mapping between the feature and which templates to use can be made in the
UI via 'Administer -> Remote Execution Features'.  Or, when seeding a template,
there is a new metadata item `feature`, which allows to assign some template as
default to the feature.

When the plugin wants to execute the paritcular feature they can use:

```
JobInvocationComposer.for_feature(:reprovision, host, :script => "grubby...").trigger!
```
