# 1. {{ page.title }}

This plugin enables Foreman to do automatic bare-metal discovery of unknown
nodes on the provisioning network. New nodes self-register into Foreman and
upload facts collected by Facter (serial id, network interfaces, memory,
disks). The registered nodes show up on Discovered Hosts page and provisioning
can be initiated either manually (via UI/CLI or API) or automatically via
predefined Discovery Rules.

All communication is through Foreman Proxy which is running a plugin and has
direct access both to the provisioning network and Foreman instance:

    --
    Discovered Host > Foreman Proxy > Foreman
    --
    Foreman > Foreman Proxy > Discovered Host
    --

# 2. Installation

There are three different components to install: Foreman Discovery plugin,
Foreman Proxy Discovery plugin (aka Smart Proxy Discovery) and Foreman
Discovery Image.

## 2.1 Foreman Discovery plugin

Foreman Discovery plugin is the main component that needs to be installed.

### 2.1.1 Installer (recommended)

As of Foreman 1.8+, the foreman-installer is able to automatically install the
package and proceed with all necessary steps. To do this, re-run the installer
with the following option:

    # foreman-installer --enable-foreman-plugin-discovery

Important note: Executing foreman-installer will re-deploy all foreman-related
configuration files. In case some changes have been made, proceed with manual
download described below.

### 2.1.2 Manual installation

To install Foreman Discovery plugin, do the following

    # yum install ruby193-rubygem-foreman_discovery

on Fedora and Red Hat systems or

    # apt-get install ruby-foreman-discovery

on Debian and Ubuntu systems.

Restart of Foreman is needed when installing the package separately.

## 2.2 Foreman Proxy Discovery plugin

Foreman Proxy Discovery plugin must be installed on all proxy hosts on the
network where discovery feature is supposed to work. It is possible to skip
this step if direct communication is planned, but configuration must be
changed in that case.

To install the plugin, do

    # yum install rubygem-smart_proxy_discovery

on Fedora and Red Hat systems or

    # apt-get install ruby-smart-proxy-discovery

on Debian and Ubuntu systems.

Foreman Proxy must be restarted after plugin installation and features must be
refreshed for the given Proxy in the Foreman interface (*Infrastructure >
Smart Proxies > a proxy > Refresh features*).

## 2.3 Foreman Discovery Image

The image is based on CentOS 7 and about 150 MB in size. There are two ways
to install the image.

### 2.3.1 Download via installer (recommended)

As of Foreman 1.8+, the foreman-installer is able to automatically download
latest stable image. For this, re-run the installer with the following option:

    # foreman-installer \
        --foreman-plugin-discovery-install-images=true

Tip: It is possible to install both Discovery plugin and image in one
installer run by providing both the options.

Important note: Executing foreman-installer will re-deploy all foreman-related
configuration files. In case some changes have been made, proceed with manual
download described below.

### 2.3.2 Manual download

Images are available [for direct
download](http://downloads.theforeman.org/discovery/)
To download the latest release to the expected location, do the following on
Fedora and Red Hat systems:

    # wget http://downloads.theforeman.org/discovery/releases/latest/fdi-image-latest.tar \
      -O - | tar x --overwrite -C /var/lib/tftpboot/boot

On Debian systems, use `/srv/tftp/boot` instead of `/var/tftpboot/boot`.

### 2.3.3 Verify signatures and checksums

To verify individual ISO/tar files, import our Discovery Plugin key
[7E81E7B0](http://keys.fedoraproject.org:11371/pks/lookup?search=0x7E81E7B0&op=get)
and verify individual files:

    # wget 'http://keys.fedoraproject.org:11371/pks/lookup?search=0x7E81E7B0&op=get' -O- | gpg --import
    # gpg --verify --multifile *.asc
    gpg: Signature made Fri 06 Nov 2015 09:42:55 AM UTC using RSA key ID 7E81E7B0
    gpg: Good signature from "Foreman Discovery <foreman-xxx@googlegroups.com>"

To verify extracted init RAM disk and linux kernel do:

    # cat /var/lib/tftpboot/boot/fdi-image/SHA256SUM
    beb3cfba7d9fb9d71481c0c8f... initrd0.img
    f03bce150d2473a28697d2988... vmlinuz0
    # sha256sum /var/lib/tftpboot/boot/fdi-image/*

On Debian systems, use `/srv/tftp/boot` instead of `/var/tftpboot/boot`.

### 2.3.4 Building own image

To build a discovery image, please visit the foreman-discovery-image git
[repository](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-discovery-image) and find
the README for further instructions.

## 2.4 Hammer CLI Foreman Discovery

### 2.4.1 Installation

Before installing make sure you have installed the
[hammer_cli_foreman plugin](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli/blob/master/doc/installation.md),

#### 2.4.1.1 rpm (Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat...)

```yum install rubygem-hammer_cli_foreman_discovery```

#### 2.4.1.2 deb (Debian, Ubuntu...)

```apt-get install ruby-hammer-cli-foreman-discovery```

#### 2.4.1.3 gem

```gem install hammer_cli_foreman_discovery```.

## 2.5 Upgrade

To upgrade Foreman Discovery follow the standard procedure of upgrading all
the Foreman packages.

New component Proxy Discovery plugin was introduced for Discovery 2.0
therefore there are two ways how to re-configure existing installation.

### 2.5.1.1 Upgrade with Proxy Discovery plugin (recommended)

Follow Manual installation > Foreman Proxy Discovery plugin from above and
proceed with the next upgrade step (Reboot discovered hosts).

### 2.5.1.2 Upgrade without Proxy Discovery plugin

Proceed with the next step (Reboot discovered hosts) and in the next section
(Configuration) make sure the kernel line in the PXELinux default template has
`proxy.type` set to `foreman` and `proxy.url` points to a *Foreman* instance.

    APPEND ... proxy.url=https://YOUR_FOREMAN proxy.type=foreman

### 2.5.3 Reboot discovered hosts

After the upgrade, if there were any existing discovered hosts, it is required
to reboot and delete them. To do this, click on Reboot and Delete buttons for
each one of them.

# 3. Configuration

The following chapter covers configuration of all the components installed.

## 3.1 Foreman Discovery plugin

Foreman Discovery relies on intercepting the normal boot process for machines
not registered in Foreman. To achieve this, the PXE *default.cfg* file needs to
be altered to instruct new machines to boot the discovery image.

## 3.1.1 Default PXE template

In the Foreman UI, go to Provisioning Templates, edit *PXELinux global
default* template and add the following after the "LABEL local" block of
options:

    LABEL discovery
    MENU LABEL Foreman Discovery
    MENU DEFAULT
    KERNEL boot/fdi-image/vmlinuz0
    APPEND initrd=boot/fdi-image/initrd0.img rootflags=loop root=live:/fdi.iso rootfstype=auto ro rd.live.image acpi=force rd.luks=0 rd.md=0 rd.dm=0 rd.lvm=0 rd.bootif=0 rd.neednet=0 nomodeset proxy.url=https://FOREMAN_PROXY_INSTANCE:8443 proxy.type=proxy
    IPAPPEND 2

The *proxy.type* option can be either *proxy* or *foreman*. In the first case
all communication goes through Smart Proxy, in the latter case the
communication goes directly to Foreman (legacy mode). This is the default when
not specified.

The *proxy.url* specifies URL of the Smart Proxy or Foreman depending on the
previous setting. Currently only http scheme is supported, https will be added
in the future. For backward compatibility, *foreman.url* is an alias for this
setting.

Once the APPEND line is modified properly, set the entry to be default via the
ONTIMEOUT option:

    ONTIMEOUT discovery

Alternatively, the Discovery image also searches for DNS SRV record named
_x-foreman._tcp. If the DNS server is configured for this (see the example for
ISC BIND below), then it is not required to provide *foreman.url* at all, but
*proxy.type* is still required.

Here is an example of ISC BIND configuration statement to set *foreman* A
record to be used with HTTPS protocol.

    _x-foreman._tcp SRV 0 5 443 foreman

You can mix both approaches and override SRV record with the command line.

It is important to keep *IPAPPEND 2* option which is key configuration option
to detect interface connected to provisioning network. Also never change or
remove *root* option, otherwise image will not boot properly.

It is important to know that DNS servers from DHCP are taken into acount for
only for the interface that was specified via the BOOTIF option. This means
when a system has multiple NICs, DNS will work for the correct interface - the
one that was booted from.

## 3.1.2 Update PXE default template

Once the template has been updated, click the *Build PXE Default* button at the
top of the Provisioning Templates page. This will instruct the TFTP proxy to
rewrite the *pxelinux.cfg/default* file.

Repeat this step every time a change is made to the default template.

## 3.1.3 Global settings

If Locations and/or Organisations are enabled, Foreman will default to using
the first Location and first Organisation for Discovered hosts. If hosts should
be placed in some other Location/Organization, alter the default settings in
*Administer > Settings > Discovered*.

There is also setting called *discovery_fact* which defaults to
*discovery_bootif*. It specify which incoming fact should be used to get the
MAC address. By default, the PXELinux BOOTIF kernel command line option is
used which gives the MAC address of the interface which was booted from.

Note that *auto_discovery* option is set to *false* by default. If you want to
trigger provisioning automatically with rules, you need to turn this setting
on. It's recommended to try provision manually first to test before proceeding.

It is possible to add any fact reported by Facter via *discovery_fact_column*
global option onto the Discovered Hosts page table as a new column. To do
that, set the value of this setting to name of a fact reported. To hide the
new column, set to a blank value.

## 3.2 Foreman Proxy Discovery plugin

Make sure *foreman_url* setting is present in the Foreman Proxy configuration file.

    # grep foreman_url /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml
    :foreman_url: https://FOREMAN_HOST

This should by done automatically by our installer. It is a good idea to check
if the host responds properly and there are no firewalls blocking the
communication.

## 3.2.1 Subnet proxy setup

All subnets with discovered nodes need this specified in Foreman so it
connects via the Foreman Proxy. To do this, go to *Infrastructure > Smart
Proxies* and verify if the desired proxy lists *Discovery* feature. If not,
click on *Refresh features* button and it will appear immediately.

In *Infrastructure > Subnets* select the desired *Discovery Proxy* for each
appropriate Subnet.

Make sure that lease pool (defined in ISC DHCP configuration) and reservation
pool (defined in *Infrastructure > Subnets*) are disjoint. More on that topic
in the [installation scenarios]({{site.baseurl}}manuals/latest/index.html#3.2.3InstallationScenarios)
section.

## 3.3 Hammer CLI Foreman Discovery plugin

The plugin must be enabled in ```cli.modules.d/foreman_discovery.yml```
(see [Hammer config directories](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli/blob/master/doc/installation.md#locations))
as follows:

    :foreman_discovery:
        :enable_module: true

## 3.4 Permissions

The plugin will create a Role called Discovery when first started. This can be
assigned to roles for non-admins to allow them to use the discovery plugin.
Alternatively assign the `perform_discovery` permission to an existing Role.

# 4. Usage

Foreman Discovery plugin provides user interface, API and CLI.

## 4.1 Hardware discovery

Boot a machine in any provisioning network that was configured with the default
PXE configuration above. It should register with Foreman and appear in
*Hosts > Discovered Hosts*.

## 4.2 Manual provisioning

Select a discovered host and choose Provision. This will redirect to the
normal Edit page for a Host, with the discovered data filled in where
possible. Fill in the details as normal.

On save, Foreman modifies the host's PXELinux file on the TFTP server and
reboots the discovered host, after which it boots into an installer for the
chosen OS, and finally into the installed OS.

Delete a machine and reboot it to have it move back to the Discovery Pool.

## 4.3 Automatic provisioning

Starting with version 2.0, it is possible to predefine provisioning rules
which will assign host group to provisioned hosts and trigger provisioning
automatically. To do that, head over to *Configure > Discovery rules* and
create such a rule:

* **Name** represents rule name shown to the users. It must not contain spaces
  or non-alphanumeric characters.
* **Search** statement is used to match discovered hosts for the particular
  rule. Use Scoped Search syntax to define it. Examples are shown below.
* **Host Group** is assigned to a matching host before starting provisioning
  process. It is very important the selected Host Group has all the required
  parameters set (domain, subnet, root password), otherwise provisioning
  process will fail.
* **Hostname** defines a pattern to assign human-readable hostnames to the
  matching hosts. When left empty, hostname is assigned in a form of
  `macMACADDRESS` by default. The same syntax as for provisioning templates is
  used. See below for more information and examples.
* **Hosts limit** enables to limit maximum amount of provisioned hosts per
  rule. If a limit was reached, the rule will not take effect until one or
  more hosts are deleted. Typical use case are rules per server rack or row
  when it is necessary to change provisioning parameters like hostname or host
  group per each entry.
* **Priority** puts the rules in order. Must be greater than zero and low
  numbers go first. Rules are always matched by priority given.
* **Enabled** flag is used for temporary shutdown of rules.
* **Organizations\Locations** discovered hosts can only auto provision
from rules in the same organization/location as the discovered host.

Once some rules are defined, the good practice is to discover a host and apply
the rules using Auto discover button on the host.

By default, Foreman does not trigger auto discovery automatically. This must
be explicitly turned on in
*Administer > Settings > Discovered > discovery_auto*.

## 4.3.1 Search syntax

Easiest way of testing search patterns is in Discovered hosts list, because
the search box gives the same results. Typical search fields are facts, they
all start with "facts.". Auto completion can be used to browse the facts as
well as discovered hosts detail screen. Typical search queries:

    facts.architecture = x86_64
    facts.bios_vendor ~ 'Dell*'
    facts.macaddress = "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"
    facts.macaddress_eth0 = "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"
    facts.ipaddress_eth1 = ~ "192.168."

As of Foreman 1.7, all the facts are currently simple strings, so it is not
possible to do numeric comparisons.

Some important facts are extracted and converted to numbers. These are:

* cpu_count - number of CPUs
* disk_count - number of disks attached
* disks_size - total amount of disk space (in MiB)

Possible queries are:

    cpu_count >= 8
    disk_count < 10
    disks_size > 1000000

See the
[searching section]({{site.baseurl}}manuals/latest/index.html#4.1.5Searching)
for more information.

## 4.3.2 Hostname patterns

The target hostname template pattern has the same syntax as in Provisioning
Templates (ERB). Domain will be appended automatically. A hostname based on
MAC address will be used when left blank. In addition to @host attribute
function rand for random integers is available. Examples:

    application-server-<%= rand(99999) %>
    load-balancer-<%= @host.facts['bios_vendor'] + '-' + rand(99999) %>
    wwwsrv-<%= @host.hostgroup.name %>
    minion-<%= @host.discovery_rule.name %>
    db-server-<%= @host.ip.gsub('.','-') + '-' + @host.hostgroup.subnet.name %>

When creating hostname patterns, make sure the resulting host names are
**unique**. This is very important. Hostnames must not start with numbers. A
good approach is to use unique information provided by facter (MAC address,
BIOS or serial ID) or to randomize the hostname somehow.

## 4.4 Hammer CLI Foreman Discovery plugin

Confirm your setup by running `hammer -h` and check that the discovery command is listed.

    $ hammer -h
    ...
    Subcommands:
     ...
     discovery                     Discovery related actions.
     ...
    ...

The actions you can use with discovery will appear as follows:

    $ hammer discovery -h
    Usage:
        hammer discovery [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND [ARG] ...

    Parameters:
     SUBCOMMAND                    subcommand
     [ARG] ...                     subcommand arguments

    Subcommands:
     auto-provision                Auto provision a host
     delete                        Delete a discovered host
     facts                         Show a discovered host
     info                          Show a discovered host
     list                          List all discovered hosts
     provision                     Provision a discovered host
     reboot                        Reboot a host
     refresh-facts                 Refresh the facts of a host

    Options:
     -h, --help                    print help

  For example to reboot a discovered_host:

    $ hammer discovery reboot -h
    Usage:
        hammer discovery reboot [OPTIONS]

    Options:
     --id ID
     --name NAME                   Name to search by
     -h, --help                    print help

    $ hammer discovery reboot --id 130
    Host reboot started

# 5. Extending the image

It is possible to extend the Foreman Discovery Image with custom facts,
software or device drivers easily. There are two ways of doing that.

## 5.1 Runtime extensions

It's possible to provide a zip file containing extra code for the image to use.
First, create a directory structure like:

    .
    ├── autostart.d
    │   └── 01_zip.sh
    ├── bin
    │   └── ntpdate
    ├── facts
    │   └── test.rb
    └── lib
        ├── libcrypto.so.1.0.0
        └── ruby
            └── test.rb

`autostart.d` contains scripts that will be executed in POSIX order by the
image as it starts up, before the host is registered to Foreman. `bin` is
added to PATH, you can place binaries here and use them in the autostart
scripts. `facts` is added to FACTERLIB so that custom facts may be
configured and sent to Foreman. `lib` is added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
`lib/ruby` is added to RUBYLIB, so that binaries in `bin` can be executed
properly.

Environment variables (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, RUBYLIB and FACTERLIB) are
appended to. If you need to specify the path to something explicitly in
your scripts, the zip contents are extracted to `/opt/extension` on the
image.

An example structure is provided in `example_zip` in this repo. You can zip
up your structure with `zip -r my_extension.zip .`

You can create multiple zip files, but be aware they will be extracted to
the same place on the discovery image, so files in later zips will overwrite
earlier ones if they have the same filename.

To inform the image of the extensions it should use, place your zip(s) on
your TFTP server along with the discovery image, and then update your
PXELinux APPEND line with `fdi.zips=<path-to-zip>,<path-to-zip>`, where the
paths are relative to the TFTP root. So if you have two zips at
$TFTP/zip1.zip and $TFTP/boot/zip2.zip, you would use
`fdi.zips=zip1.zip,boot/zip2.zip`.

## 5.2 Image building with extensions

The very same ZIP file with the structure described above can be injected into
your own image. This is useful for network drivers when there is a chicken and
egg problem.

To build a discovery image with extensions, please visit the
foreman-discovery-image git
[repository](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-discovery-image) and find
the README for further instructions.

# 6 Help

Please follow our [standard procedures and
contacts]({{site.baseurl}}support.html). For problems with the image, send us
the output of the following command for a running discovered node (see below
how to get access to the shell):

    # discovery-debug

## 6.1 Troubleshooting

If you find a bug, please file it in
[Redmine](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/discovery/issues/new).

See the [troubleshooting section]({{site.baseurl}}manuals/latest/index.html#7.2GettingHelp)
in the Foreman manual for more info.

## 6.1.1 Troubleshooting plugins

If the booted machine fails to register with Foreman, then there are a number
of common causes:

* Machine did not boot the correct image
  * Check your default PXE Linux template and try to re-deploy it
  * Check your pxelinux.cfg/default configuration file on the TFTP Proxy
* Machine booted image but failed to contact Foreman
  * Check the proxy.url and proxy.type options
  * Check DNS is working for that image, or use an IP in proxy.url
  * Check DHCP is handing IPs to the booted image correctly

## 6.1.2 Troubleshooting the image

First of all make sure your server (or VM) has more than 500 MB of memory
because less memory can lead to various random kernel panic errors as the
image needs to be extracted in-place (150 MB * 2).

The first virtual console is reserved for logs, all systemd logging is
shown there. Particularly useful system logs are tagged with:

* discover-host - initial facts upload
* foreman-discovery - facts refresh, reboot remote commands
* nm-prepare - boot script which pre-configures NetworkManager
* NetworkManager - networking information

The root account and ssh access are disabled by default, but you can enable
ssh and set root password using the following kernel command line options:

    fdi.ssh=1 fdi.rootpw=redhat

Use tty2 console (or higher) to login onto a discovered host.
