# Foreman Privacy Policy

This document describes the data Foreman collects about you, why it is
collected, what is done with it, and your options for how it's processed.

The Foreman project does not share data with 3rd parties, except for hosting
requirements (e.g. GitHub, YouTube) as detailed below, or when required to by
law.

# Types of data we collect

* Contact details
  * Name
  * Email address
* Data that identifies you
  * IP addresses
  * Browser UserAgent strings
  * Debug archives
  * Answers to survey questions

# How and why we use your data

## The website

The Foreman website is a static site which does not track, collect, store
information or set cookies. There is no account for the website itself. The
webserver (Apache) logs will contain IP addresses, timestamps, and UserAgent
strings - these are log-rotated and deleted after 4 weeks.

The website also uses Google Analytics, but we only collect anonymous data. IP
addresses are [anonymised][GA-anonIP], and we do not use User-ID, or any linked
Google product (e.g. AdWords). Google Analytics data is deleted after 26 months
(the default for Google Analytics).

The webserver logs and Google Analytics are used to produce aggregated
statistics about the community, such as popularity of different browsers,
operating system packages, plugins, etc.

* Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest

### Website videos

The website does embed videos from YouTube, FOSDEM, and Slideshare - see the
links below for details:

  * [YouTube's privacy policy][YouTube]
  * [FOSDEM homepage](https://fosdem.org)
  * [SlideShare (LinkedIn) privacy policy][SlideShare]

for details. These videos do not autoplay.

### Website downloads

The downloads from our website are cached by Fastly, a CDN provider. This may
also log your IP address - see [Fastly's privacy policy][Fastly] for details.
We don't currently use this data at all, but we may use it for aggregated
statistics in the future.

## Codebase

The Foreman community use [GitHub](https://github.com) to manage the code that
comprises the Foreman project. Refer to [GitHub's privacy policy][GitHub] for
details on how GitHub handles the data you post there.

Commit messages can contain names and email addresses. You are free to use
psuedonymous data for commit messages. We do prefer a working contact mail in
case of needing to contact contributors to the codebase, but it is not
mandatory.

We also use non-identifiable data from the codebase to provide aggregated
statistics such as average time to merge, number of open pull requests, etc.

* Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest, consent

The Foreman community also runs a self-hosted bug tracker using the
[Redmine](https://www.redmine.org) software. When you sign up for a Redmine
account, you provide us with an email address and a name.

Externally, we only use this email within Redmine to contact you about bugs you
have reported or subscribed to. You have full control over what emails are sent
from your Redmine account preferences.

Email addresses can also be linked to GitHub commits (see above) if the emails
match, or manually by an admin (on request). This enables Redmine to
automatically attribute issue changes to your user, based on the public commit
data from the GitHub repositories (e.g. closing it when you fix an issue). This
populates your Redmine "activity" page, which is public.

The bug tracker also uses cookies to store your session.

We also use the bug tracker data to provide aggregated statistics such as
number of open/closed bugs, average time to close a bug, etc.

* Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest, consent

## Communication

The Foreman project maintains two public IRC channels on
[Freenode](https://freenode.net), refer to [Freenode's privacy
policy][Freenode] for details on how they handle your data. In addition, our
*public* channels are logged to [BotBot.me](https://botbot.me) who also have a
[privacy policy][BotBot].

The Foreman community uses a self-hosted forum using the
[Discourse](https://discourse.org) software. When signing up for a Discourse
account, you provide a name and email address - and in addition we store the IP
address of your most recent connection. The email address is only used to send
you updates to your forum topics, personal messages from other users, and
digest summaries. You have full control over the emails sent from your
Discourse account preferences. The forum also uses cookies to store your
session.

We also use the IP addresses and *public* post data to provide aggregated
statistics about the forum community, such as posts-per-month, user engagement,
etc. We also use the IP addresses to help identify [sock
puppeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockpuppet_(Internet)) and spam
accounts.

* Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest, consent

## Surveys

The Foreman community runs a survey each year. Completing the survey is opt-in,
and providing a contact email address in the survey is *optional*. Such
addresses are stored until the survey analysis is complete, and then deleted
from the raw survey data before publication. The survey data is used to gain
understanding of the community, and aggregated statistics based on the survey
results are published each year.

* Legal basis for this data usage: Legitimate interest, consent

## Foreman debug archives

The Foreman project provides a tool called [foreman-debug][foreman debug] which
collects logs from your Foreman server and uploads it to a secure location in
our infrastructure. Use of this tool is entirely voluntary (it is never run
automatically), and the data is used by our developers to assist users in
debugging complex problems. The data is not used for any analysis or
statistics, is only accessible to a small number of the Foreman developers, and
is deleted regularly.

* Legal basis for this data usage: Consent

# Your rights regarding your data

## Your choices

### You can choose not to provide us with personal data

Using a VPN, Tor, or other IP / UserAgent masking service will not affect your
use of the project website, as it is entirely static. For Redmine & Discourse,
we do not mandate use of real names, and using pseudonyms will not affect the
services.

### Your accounts on our services

Your Redmine & Discourse accounts contain options to control what emails are
sent to you. 3rd party services such as [GitHub](https://github.com) retain
their own policies and privacy options.

## Your rights

* The right to object to our use of your personal data
* The right to receive your personal data in a usable electronic format and transmit it to a third party (also known as the right of data portability)
* The right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so by contacting
the Foreman Project at [contact us](mailto:privacy AT community.theforeman.org)
or on [IRC](/support.html#IRClivechat). Please understand, however, the rights
enumerated above are not absolute in all cases, especially in regards to the
right to erase your data:

  * Git commits will not be rewritten
    * contributing to the codebase is opt-in,
    * providing personally identifying information in commit messages is a further opt-in
    * we have a legitimate interest in contacting contributors and showing IP provenance
  * Redmine & Discourse data which is *public* (i.e forum posts, bug comments etc) will be pseudonymised
    * Your account name, handle, and email address will be scrambled, removing your personal data from the site
    * Posts are *not* removed, as we have a legitimate interest in retaining the history of discussions about our project
