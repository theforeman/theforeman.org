# Professional Services
------------------------------

While Foreman is free and open source, and the Foreman community does everything it can to [support](https://theforeman.org/support.html) users, sometimes users cannot get to where they want to be without professional help. Foreman is a complex tool. To get started, you require a certain level of Linux sysadmin knowledge.  

While you might know that Foreman is the tool for you, you might not have the necessary skills or the time to to install and configure it on your own.

For many years, there have been a number of companies and consultants providing professional services to clients who want to set up, deploy, maintain, and extend Foreman. There are also companies that productize Foreman and provide long term support and services around those products,

We have had several requests on our community Discourse for names of professional services. This page has been created as an easy way to provide a reference both for those asked and those looking for professional services.

If youâ€™re a consultant or professional who has Foreman expertise and want your details listed here, please consider writing a [guest blog post](https://github.com/theforeman/theforeman.org/#contributing-a-blog-post) outlining your involvement with the Foreman community and your area of focus, and we can use those details to add an entry to this page.
