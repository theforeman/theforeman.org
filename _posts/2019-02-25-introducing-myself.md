I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself, I am Rahul Bajaj and I 
have been working as a Software Engineer at Red Hat for a year and a half now. I 
am the co-maintainer of Foreman Discovery Plugin and also contribute to repos like 
Foreman core, hammer-cli-foreman, forklift, and pulp. Currently I am working 
on integrating SSO with Foreman via Keycloak.

I have always been interested in community where I keep meeting new like-minded 
people that share the same interests as mine. Talking of the Foreman community, 
I run the Foreman Pune Meetups chapter, where my main aim is to introduce new 
contributors to the project and ask them about their experience working with it. 

I like to speak about my work and have done so in various conferences like 
[TheDevTheory Conf](https://thedevtheory.com/#rahulbajaj), [DevConf.in](https://devconfin2018.sched.com/speaker/rahul_bajaj.1y7e64ly), 
[libera.chat #live](https://libera.chat.live/), etc. As excinting it is to speak at a conference, 
I take immense pleasure in volunteering too and have been a part of conferences 
like Pycon India, DevConf.in, rails girls, fedora meetups, Pycon India, Ruby Conf, 
etc. If you are interested in reading any of my experiences then hereâ€™s my [blog](https://rahulbajaj05.wordpress.com). 

Community to me has always been about give and take, when I was a student, I 
learned a lot from the community(I am still doing the same) and now I like 
going to colleges and teaching students such that one day they can mentor 
someone else and the chain continues. 

Currently my short term aim is to change the look and feel of the foreman 
documentation. I am also working on creating a quickstart guide that will 
help the new contributors for getting started quickly. 

I am really looking forward to work with the community, I have so much to 
learn from all of you guys. Feel free to reach out to me for anything :)
