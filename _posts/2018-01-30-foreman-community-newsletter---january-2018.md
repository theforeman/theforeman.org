### Community survey 2018

As usual for the start of the year, the next iteration of the Foreman Community
survey is ready for you to fill out! Last year we had over 200 responses - can
you help us go even higher this year?

The survey is a great opportunity to help us shape the direction of the
project, so please do drop by and give us your thoughts. It should only take a
few minutes. Thanks!
