systems management projects for two days after FOSDEM 2014, and is a

### Foreman 1.3.1 update released

The first update to Foreman 1.3 has been released, fixing a number of
bugs found in 1.3.0.  
  
More information in [the
announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foreman-announce/vZR9esJzBUE)
and [release
notes](http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.3/index.html#Releasenotesfor1.3.1).  
  

### Foreman Discovery oVirt-based image

Lukas Zapletal has announced a new image based on <span
id="goog_917828814"></span>oVirt Node which contains a far better range
of drivers and firmware for systems, and is RPM-based.  It works as a
plugin to oVirt, so it extends the existing image building mechanism,
which you can replicate and customize.

MCollective plugins.
