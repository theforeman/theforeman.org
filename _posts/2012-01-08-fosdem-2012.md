I've finally wrapped up all my bookings, and I'll be attending both
fosdem days and the following the
\#[monitoringsucks](http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/monitoringsucks-and-well-fix-it) hackfest.

It looks like we have a bunch of Foreman users there as well, so I hope
we could get together, either during Friday(unless there is a devops
dinner) or the following days (I'll get
to Brussels during Friday morning).

Anyone has a recommendation of for where/when we can meet?

Hope to see you guys there!
