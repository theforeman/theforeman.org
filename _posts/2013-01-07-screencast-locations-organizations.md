One of the most important features that will be released soon as part of
Foreman 1.1 is locations & organizations. We will probably do a deep
dive (which will get recorded) pretty soon, but I recorded a quick
screencast to show how they work. Enjoy!

  

The volume in the recording is low, but it gets very degraded when I try
to increase the gain so make sure to crank up your output.
