## New Tutorials this month!

### Setting up Foreman and using it with Ansible

Community member [@besmirzanaj](https://community.theforeman.org/u/besmirzanaj) got bored of manually configuring things. This boredom led him to automating Foreman using Ansible. In true community spirit, he has shared a tutorial so that you can too! Check out his [Setting up Foreman and Managing it with Ansible](https://community.theforeman.org/t/set-up-foreman-and-manage-it-with-ansible/22717) tutorial in our community Discourse.

If you want to know what's new with Foreman Ansible Modules, and what you have to look forward to, check out [@evgeni](https://community.theforeman.org/u/evgeni/)'s update from Community Demo #91:

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback about using the tutorials, please post to our [Community Discourse](https://community.theforeman.org).

## The future of the new Puppet plugin

The work on the extraction of Puppet from Foreman is close to completion, and as a result of this, the functionality that once existed in Foreman-core will now reside in a new Puppet plugin. We hosted a meeting to gather everyone who is interested in the future of the Puppet plugin, especially its future maintenance. [@ezr-ondrej](https://community.theforeman.org/u/ezr-ondrej/) led this meeting and another meeting will take place in about a month. You can rewatch the meeting here, and we will advertise the future meeting soon.
