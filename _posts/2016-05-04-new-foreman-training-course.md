Foreman now has a training course! The awesome folks over at NETWAYS decided to
release their Foreman material as an open project for the community to use and
contribute to. Read on for details!

# The background

A while ago, I got talking to [Dirk GÃ¶tz][dirk] over at
[NETWAYS][netways], and learned that they had been working on a training
course for Foreman, so that they could offer it as part of their training
progamme. I was interested in finding out more, as it's something that until
now we haven't had in the Foreman community.

Dirk kindly agreed to let me take a look at the material, and I was impressed!
Weighing in at over 180 pages, covering not just basic Foreman activities, but
also a lot of the plugins too, there was a lot of good stuff here... and then
inspiration struck! We'd had comments on the [community survey][survey] that
the manual was too dry for some people's learning style... so maybe a training
course would be a good alternative for those looking to get to grips with
Foreman in a more hands-on way.

# Opening it up

Excited now, not just to be able to offer something new, but also to provide a
solution to some of the feedback we'd had, we approached Dirk and NETWAYS with
the suggestion to release the training course as an open collaboration, for the
benefit of the Foreman community. To my great delight, they agreed!

You can find the training course on our new [Training Page][training] or
on the [NETWAYS github.io site][rendered]. The course is designed as a 2 day
workshop, and is available to both those looking to self-study or provide
Foreman training of their own.

You can read Dirk's own thoughts on this on [his blog][blog], or listen to us
discuss the release on last week's [community demo][demo].

# What next?

Of course, we'd really like to see contributions to this - if you're giving or
taking the training and see any problems, please do send us [patches][patches].
If you're a plugin developer, perhaps consider adding a [module][plugins] to
the course for your plugin?

Also, if you do decide to do training courses of your own, consider letting us
know - you can add such events to our shiny new [events page][events]!
