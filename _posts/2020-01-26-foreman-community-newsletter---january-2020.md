 Conferences and Community Survey!
---

Community Survey is now Live!

### Community Survey

The [Survey](https://community.theforeman.org/t/the-2020-foreman-community-survey-is-live/16881)
is open!!

As every year we use our conference season as an opportunity to get as much feedback
as we can from you! Those who attend conferences have a chance to talk to our developers
face to face but for not everyone is there and we don't have a chance to ask each of
you about everything they use so answering the survey is the best way to reach us and
make sure we are focused on your issues in the upcoming year.


### 1.24.2 released!

It's been a busy month with 2 releases for 1.24 - [1.24.1] with 21 fixes
and 1.24.2 which adds 4 fixes, one of which was an important migration fix
and also a significant performance improvement of fact cleanup! 
See the full details in the [announcement][1_24_2]. 

Reminder: This will be the last version before Foreman 2.0 so please notice all the deprecation
warnings in the [release notes][1_24].

As ever, many thanks to the contributors to this release - coders, RC testers,
documentation writers, and bug/feature reporters. Foreman wouldn't be what it
is without you! If you do find issues with, please do [report them!][issues]

### Katello 3.14.1 and 3.13.4 are out!

Katello [3.14.1][k_3_14_1] is a small but significant version which
fixes a bug that was preventing content hosts from subscribing to non-Red Hat repositories. 
This fix was also added to the 3.13 version, releasing [3.13.4][k_3_13_4].
Huge thanks to all the contributors to this release - as with core, we couldn't
put out these releases without you! Further issues with Katello should be
[reported][k_issues], as always.

Great to see everyone that visited us at the booth!
And thank you to Nikhil Kathole for your talk 
["Foreman Single Sign On Made Easy With Keycloak"](https://devconfcz2020a.sched.com/event/YOpy/foreman-single-sign-on-made-easy-with-keycloak).

* [Community Demo #72](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-72)

For those of you that have been following our demos live, we have been experiencing
technical issues with the live broadcast.
This is a result of YouTube dropping the option to use Hangouts on Air.
We are working on other live solutions but for now all of our demos are recorded and
uploaded right after the time slot we publicize.

If anyone would like to join us live, please reach out and we'll send out a link we use
for the presenters.

A new UI interest group was formed to talk about all things UI related in Foreman and
plugins. If you'd like to join the meetings the are weekly on Monday.
