## Foreman @ FOSDEM

This coming Saturday, there will be two Foreman talks in the [Infra Management devroom](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/infra_management/) room at [FOSDEM 2021](https://fosdem.org).

* [Your management layer should be cattle too](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/yourmanagementlayershouldbecattletoo/)
* [Application centric deployment with Foreman/Katello](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/applicationcentricdeploymentwithforemankatello/)

Please join us for these talks and there will be an opportunity to ask questions in the infra management matrix room after the talk.

## Introduction to Foreman resources:

[@mhulan](https://community.theforeman.org/u/Marek_Hulan) has been busy writing blogs to help you get started with Foreman.

In his first blog [How to start with Foreman](https://theforeman.org/2020/12/how-to-start-with-foreman.html) [@mhulan](https://community.theforeman.org/u/Marek_Hulan) introduces important concepts and guides you through the host registration and management fundamentals.

In his next blog [Updating Foreman inventory with system facts](https://theforeman.org/2021/01/updating-foreman-inventory-with-system-facts.html), [@mhulan](https://community.theforeman.org/u/Marek_Hulan) walks you through how you can keep inventories up to date by receiving facts from hosts regularly. This post shows how you have multiple options to use Foreman as a powerful configuration management tool.

## Using Foreman to Manage CentOS Stream hosts

The future of CentOS was discussed in the Foreman community and as a result of this, [@lzap](https://community.theforeman.org/u/lzap/) created a tutorial that demonstrates how you can remain in full control of your CentOS stream environments using Foreman. If you are a new user, this video also serves as a nice introduction to the Foreman & Katello content management and provisioning workflows:

The first community demo of 2021 was so action packed that it ran over the hour! You can rewatch the demos here. The YouTube video is now broken into chapters and timestamped per demo:

## Katello Pulp 3 Import/Export Deep Dive

[@partha_aji1](https://community.theforeman.org/u/partha_aji1) took some time to delve into the Katello team's work on the Hammer Import/Export functionality changes as part of the migration to Pulp 3. You can rewatch the deep dive here:

## RFCs of Note in the Community

Over the last month, there have been a number of important conversations happening in the Foreman community, here are some of the highlights:

* [@ehelms](https://community.theforeman.org/u/ehelms) started a discussion around [Smart Proxy: Future Design, Scaling and Use Cases](https://community.theforeman.org/t/smart-proxy-future-design-scaling-and-use-cases/21992)
* [@ekohl](https://community.theforeman.org/u/ekohl) opened a discussion about [Smart Proxy Feature Classes](https://community.theforeman.org/t/smart-proxy-feature-classes/21719) with the aim to figure out how to model Smart Proxy Feature classes in Foreman.
* [@ezr-ondrej](https://community.theforeman.org/u/ezr-ondrej) brought up how Puppet environments being quite often abused for other purposes. When Puppet is extracted from Foreman core, a new [Global environments](https://community.theforeman.org/t/global-environments/22057) concept is proposed to be kept in Foreman core.
