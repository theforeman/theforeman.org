As you may be aware from [previous mails][users-list], [YouTube
content][youtube] and the [newsletter][news], we've been debating for about a
month on moving to a forum for our community interaction. That debate has run
it's course, and the conclusion is clear - a move to Discourse is popular.

Accordingly, I am now setting in motion the [plan for the
migration][migration]. Today, I'm notifying all 3 lists that they will be
switched to read-only on 31st Dec (3 weeks away).

# What do I need to do?

Firstly, claim your Discourse account (if you haven't yet) - if you've
ever *posted* to the mailing list, then you already have an account, and
can use the "Forgot Password" option on your email address to get logged
in (or use GitHub login, if the email is the same there).

(If you're a lurker and have never posted, then you'll have to create
the account yourself, sorry. Don't be shy though, now's a good time :P).

Once logged in there's an FAQ banner at the top to help you get started
(with links to more in-depth topics), and Discobot (the forum bot) will
message you with some tips too. You can dismiss the banner with the "X"
once you're done with it.

Any questions, you can [send a message to me][message] on the forum and I'll
respond as soon as I can (using the forum helps me collect them into an FAQ).
If you prefer, you can also post in the "Site Feedback" category.

# What happens next?

During the next few weeks I'll be tweaking Discourse to suit our needs
(groups, tags, settings, etc) and writing docs to help orient new users.
I'm *very* interested in hearing from the first few users who jump on
about how easy to find the docs are, and how helpful.

I'll also be updating the Google Groups web interface with a deprecation
notice, and preparing PRs to the website to point new users at
Discourse. If you spot anything where we can improve sign-posting for
people, [get in touch][message].

The lists will remain functional for now, but I would encourage people
starting *new* threads to consider using the forum. The entire list
archive will be merged to the forum, so nothing will be lost, but it
means you get a head start on getting used to Discourse, we can help
you get oriented, and you can test our docs (and thanks for that!).

Do hang tight, I'm sure *something* unexpected will come up - but we're
shooting for the quietest time of year, and once we're up and running, I
think this will be good for all of us. More updates will follow in due
course :)
