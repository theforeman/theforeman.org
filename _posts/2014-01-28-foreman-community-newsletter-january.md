Foreman plugin, with a new combined installer.  
  
If you're interested in trying it out in the early stages and report
bugs, [read Eric's

### Further watching

The last development sprint was completed at the beginning of December,
and the sprint demo shows lots of features that are either available in
nightly or upcoming work.  
  
This includes user data support, an update on the permissions system
changes, compute profiles, dynamic API bindings and Puppet future parser
support.
