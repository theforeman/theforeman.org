[release announcement](https://community.theforeman.org/t/katello-4-0-0-rc2-is-ready-for-testing/22570).

## Foreman Ansible Modules v 2.0.0

[Foreman Ansible Modules v2.0.0](https://galaxy.ansible.com/theforeman/foreman) was released!

[@evgeni](https://community.theforeman.org/u/evgeni/summary) will regale us all about the updates in v2.0.0 in the [upcoming community demo](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-91/22405?u=mcorr), but if you can't wait, here's a summary of the new features:

*  new modules: `host_info`, `repository_info` and `puppetclasses_import`
*  new roles: `activation_keys`, `lifecycle_environments`, `repositories`, `sync_plans`
*  host module can now look up the correct network id for a network given as part of `interfaces_attributes`

Breaking changes:

    All role variables are now prefixed with `foreman_` to avoid clashes with similarly named variables from roles outside this collection.

If you're super curious, there's also the [full changelog](https://theforeman.github.io/foreman-ansible-modules/v2.0.0/CHANGELOG.html#v2-0-0).

## Community Demo #90

At the last community demo, we had two first-time demoers! They're very welcome, as are you to sign up and demo something you're working on, or ask for feedback on something in progress but not quite there yet:

[@msinghal](https://community.theforeman.org/u/msinghal) demoed how to **Register Content Host with different OSes** and  **Katello: Content View Filter for APT Repositories**.

There was a drop in network connection during the final demo, both on [@msinghal](https://community.theforeman.org/u/msinghal)'s side and ours, so nothing was actually lost :-)

[@laugmanuel](https://community.theforeman.org/u/laugmanuel) demoed a new Foreman plugin called **Foreman Vault** that is an interface between Foreman and HashiCorp Vault where you can store secrets, certificates, and passwords:

Our full line up is [here](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-90/22282?u=mcorr). The YouTube video and event in Foreman Community Discourse has all the time stamps of each of the demos. Any feedback, let us know.

Our next demo takes place on March 4. You can sign up [here](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-91/22405?u=mcorr).

## Foreman Community Demo #100

At some point this year, (kudos to anyone who reads this and tells me the date), we will hit upon our 100th Foreman Community Demo. We would like to do something special, something out of the ordinary. If you have any ideas, please drop your idea in the reply comments here or open a thread on the [Foreman Community Discourse](https://community.theforeman.org/).

## UX Interest Group's @theforeman/vendor sub-package deep dive

[@sharvit](https://community.theforeman.org/u/sharvit) explains how Foreman core and plugins import shared packages from Foremanâ€™s vendor, and also why the test environment is different from development and production by its dependencies usage.

## Community RFCs this month

### REX Pull Provider

As Katello 4.0 comes closer to release, bringing with it major changes, an important discussion about the workflow for a [REX Pull Provider](https://community.theforeman.org/t/rfc-rex-pull-provider/21593) have been ongoing for a few months, with a call for feedback at several stages, including during the previous community demo. [@Justin_Sherrill](https://community.theforeman.org/u/Justin_Sherrill) provided a [recent update](https://community.theforeman.org/t/rfc-rex-pull-provider/21593/28?u=mcorr), with some important discoveries about the implications of some of the options explored. If you have any thoughts on the work flows mentioned, please reply to the discussion, even simply to voice your agreement.

### Menu navigation - Search & go component

[@lstejskal](https://community.theforeman.org/u/lstejskal) raised a UX-related issue about the difficulties in finding specific menus within Foreman and proposed a [search capability](https://community.theforeman.org/t/rfc-menu-navigation-search-go-component/22474) for retrieving menu items.

## Thank You!

Thank you to everyone who asked and answered questions, opened issues, and made the Foreman community a vibrant place to be over the last month!
