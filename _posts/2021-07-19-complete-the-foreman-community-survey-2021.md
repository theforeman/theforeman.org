Who doesn't love surveys?

<!--more-->

Community regulars will know that we do a community survey every year, and 2021 is no exception.
This is our yearly attempt to understand more about the fine folks that use our project, how changes we’ve made are being received, and work out what’s important to tackle next.

By telling us how you're using Foreman, you help inform the decisions we make plans for the future and shape the future of Foreman.

Foreman doesn’t contain any form of tracking, so we literally have no other way to gather a lot of this data. Help us out!

Please find ten minutes to [take the survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/T526T3G)!

Thank you!
