### Videos and presentations

Early in February, we enjoyed [an excellent
meetup](https://plus.google.com/u/0/113971026133807813676/posts) of
Foreman users and developers in Belgium for the combination of FOSDEM
and the Foreman track at CfgMgmtCamp.  
  
Lots of visitors stopped by the stand at FOSDEM shared with oVirt, where
a demo of the newly released Foreman 1.4.0 [was on
display](https://plus.google.com/113971026133807813676/posts/ZBkPw3DnWcB). 
At CfgMgmtCamp, a series of interesting talks was held over the two
days, with subjects from Foreman deployment through to plugin
development.  
  
Recordings of some presentations are now available:

### Foreman 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 released

At the start of February (ready for FOSDEM), Foreman 1.4.0 was released
and followed up with a bug fix release (1.4.1) a few weeks later.  Users
are urged to upgrade to 1.4.1 to fix [a few important
bugs](http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.4/index.html#Releasenotesfor1.4.1),
such as errors when deleting compute resources and compute profile
fixes.  
  
Key new features are compute profiles, image user-data (cloud-init)
support, web UI enhancements, Kerberos support, a new plugin
registration and extension framework, plus lots of new provider support
in the smart proxy.  Lots more information is available in the [Foreman
1.4 release
notes](http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.4/index.html#Releasenotesfor1.4).  
  

### Further watching

After the bug fix push for Foreman 1.4, another sprint [has been
completed](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foreman-dev/l7QicraKGNc)
with some new features already in the works and being committed ready
for Foreman 1.5 in a few months' time.  
  
This includes improved host registration, i18n support in Hammer, plugin
support in the installer, config groups for Puppet classes, oVirt and
libvirt imaging support and Docker compute resources.  Have a look at
the demos here:

or topic.  Join the [Foreman Google+
