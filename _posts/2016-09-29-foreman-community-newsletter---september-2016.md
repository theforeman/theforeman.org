### Foreman 1.13 RC2 released

Foreman 1.13 RC2 is now available for general testing - and this is a big one!
We've got the initial work on IPv6 (addressing and partial orchestration), UEFI
and GRUB2 bootloader support, improvements to DHCP subnet parsing, Compute
Resource upgrades (notably OpenStack Liberty), and support for Facter 2's
structured facts - and that's just the headlines!

With so many new features, your help is needed more than ever to test this
release and ensure it meets the rock-solid quality expected of our releases.
You can find out more and get involved from the [announcement][1_13_rc1] and
please do report any [bugs][bugs]. Thanks!

### 1.12.3 released

The latest point release of the Foreman 1.12 series is now available, bringing
bugfixes and support for Puppet Server 2.6. You can read all the details in the
[announcement][1_12_3]

### EL6 deprecated in 1.13, to be removed in 1.14

Users of EL6 / Centos6 should be aware that 1.13 will be the last release with
packages for this OS. 1.13 will be supported until early next year, and users
are strongly encouraged to start planning their migrations before that date.

Note that installation of EL6 hosts from Foreman is still supported - it's the
packages for Foreman itself that will no longer be produced for EL6.

1.13 RC packages are currently missing for EL6 - this is being worked on, so
look for them in the near future.

### Katello 3.1 and 3.2 RC1

The long-awaited Katello 3.1 release happened on September 9th, bringing a
welcome round of improvements. You can learn more via the
[announcement][K_3_1].

Hot on 3.1's heels, Katello 3.2 RC1 has just been released - notably bring
support for Puppet 4 to Katello. As always, your testing is hugely appreciated
in making these releases as stable as possible - if you'd like to try it out,
check out [this thread][K_3_2_rc1] and [let us know][kbugs] how it goes.
Thanks!
