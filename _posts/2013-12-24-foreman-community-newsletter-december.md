Welcome to the last community newsletter of the year, for December
2013.

### Foreman 1.3.2 update released

A bug fix release for Foreman core is now available, version 1.3.2.  A
new version of the Hammer CLI is also included, with lots of updates. 
This will likely be the last minor release before Foreman 1.4 is out
early in 2014.  
  
More information in [the
announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foreman-announce/STNA1qboETU)
and [release
notes](http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.3/index.html#Releasenotesfor1.3.2).  
  

### Debian plugin packages

Plugin packages are now available for Debian and Ubuntu distributions
from our main Debian repositories.  One important caveat is that they
require internet access (to rubygems.org) on the system they're
installed on.  The repository isn't versioned, so plugins are usually
compatible with Foreman 1.3.  
  
Add this to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ to enable the repo:  
  
<span
style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">deb
http://deb.theforeman.org/ plugins main</span>  
  
<span style="font-family: inherit;">See the plugin list to find out
which plugins are available as Debian or RPM packages.</span>

### Upcoming events

At the start of February, many Foreman developers and users will gather
at the [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2014/) and
[CfgMgmtCamp](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/) events in Brussels, Belgium.  
  
Some Foreman-related talks will be at FOSDEM:

    others](https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/foreman_integration_chef/),

At CfgMgmtCamp, we'll hold a dedicated Foreman track with a variety of
talks.  The schedule is being confirmed, and will be available on [the
CfgMgmtCamp website](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/Foreman.html).  Don't forget

### Further watching

The last development sprint was completed at the beginning of December,
and the sprint demo shows lots of features that are either available in
nightly or upcoming work.  
  
This includes improvements to Hammer CLI, MCollective command execution,
API enhancements and improved libvirt support.
