Since version 1.3 the Foreman is shipped with new command line interface
- \[Hammer\]. The goal is to provide full featured alternative to web
user interface. In the first post of Hammer series we will focus on
installation and configuration.  

<!--more-->
  
Hammer can be installed from the same rpm or deb
[repository](http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.3/index.html#3.3InstallFromPackages)
as the Foreman server. As an alternative it can be installed from
[rubygems.org](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli#installation-from-gems)
or from
[sources](http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.3/index.html#CLI%28Hammer%29).
For this post we will assume that you want to access your Foreman from
Fedora 19. For the alternatives please check the [hammer
docs](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli#installation).  
  
To install Hammer  

    # configure yum repo
    yum localinstall \
        'http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/latest/f19/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm'

    # install the hammer package
    yum install rubygem-hammer_cli_foreman

  
Now we can take a look at configuration. For a start, copy:  

    :modules:
        - hammer_cli_foreman

    :foreman:
        :host: 'https://foreman.my.net/'
        :username: 'admin'
        :password: 'changeme'

    :log_dir: '~/.foreman/log'
    :log_level: 'error'

  
to the file ~/.foreman/cli-config.yml  
  
This configuration turns on the module with Foreman commands, sets the
server URL and your credentials and some basic logging. For more options
check again the
[manual](http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.3/index.html#3.5.6CLI) or
[hammer
docs](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli#format-and-locations). It
is also good to know that the configuration is looked up on the
following locations and is loaded in this order:  

1.  /etc/foreman/cli\_config.yml
2.  ~/.foreman/cli\_config.yml
3.  ./config/cli\_config.yml              \#config dir in CWD
4.  custom location specified on command line - -c CONF\_FILE\_PATH

Later files have precedence if they redefines the same option.  
  
And we are done. Now you can test that it works:  

    $ hammer -h

    Usage:
        hammer [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND [ARG] ...
    Parameters:
        SUBCOMMAND                    subcommand
