  Conferences wrap up, Foreman 2.0, and a new Community Manager!
---

### Conferences

We had quite a presence at FOSDEM and Config Management Camp! We had our usual booth at FOSDEM, which was a bit less crowded than past years thanks to its new location. We continued on to Gent with a shared Foreman/Pulp track and booth at Config Management Camp as well as a bunch of Foreman-related talks in other tracks.  We held our annual community dinner there as well, with nearly 40 people attending. The conference concluded with our Foreman construction day as well as some intro to Foreman training by Dirk Götz from Netways.
Thank you to all the organizers, speakers, booth staffers and community members who took part and made it such a great event!

### Foreman 2.0

We are currently in the final stages of releasing Foreman 2.0. This is the first major release of Foreman in nearly 8 years! As such, it comes with some major architectural changes and removal of some deprecated behaviors and APIs. Some highlights include converging on PostgreSQL as the only supported database and a new Sidekiq-based implementation of Dynflow. Be sure to read the release notes and upgrade warnings carefully prior to upgrading to this version!
You can follow the release announcements on our [community forum](https://community.theforeman.org/c/release-announcements/8) - expect the official announcement there in the next few days.

### New Community Manager

It's been about a year since Greg Sutcliffe left his role as the Foreman community manager, and in that time the responsibilities were divided between Ori Rabin, Rahul Bajaj and Tomer Brisker. Next month we will have a new community manager starting - so look out for their introduction post in the near future.

### Community Survey

The [Survey](https://community.theforeman.org/t/the-2020-foreman-community-survey-is-live/16881) has been closed and we are busy processing the results and looking for interesting insights that will help drive the development of Foreman in the future. Look out for a blog post in the future with some more information. Thank you everyone who took the time to answer!

### [Upcoming Events](https://community.theforeman.org/c/events/l/calendar)

All Foreman events are available via [the forum
calendar](https://community.theforeman.org/calendar) - hit the Subscribe button
(which will give you an ICS link). You can also use the "Add To Calendar" button
on specific events if you don't wish to import the whole thing.

* [Community Demo #76](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-76)

Every few weeks we host a Community Demo to showcase new & interesting developments from
the Foreman community. We encourage participation from any member of the community
(although you do need a Google account), so if you’ve been working on something cool,
please do come show it off.


### [Past Events](https://community.theforeman.org/c/events/l/latest)

* [Community Demo #73](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-73)
* [Community Demo #74](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-74)
* [Community Demo #75](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-75)

For those of you that have been following our demos live, we have been experiencing
technical issues with the live broadcast.
This is a result of YouTube dropping the option to use Hangouts on Air.
We are working on other live solutions but for now all of our demos are recorded and
uploaded right after the time slot we publicize.

If anyone would like to join us live, please reach out and we'll send out a link we use
for the presenters.
