### Foreman celebrated its 6 year anniversary

The
first [commit](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/commit/5563217a427f3786affdfb1c9e4584f04c0303e7)
was on July 13, 2009. To celebrate, we got some [new
T-shirts](https://twitter.com/ripcurld0/status/625622406841761792).  

### Foreman 1.9 RC3 is out, 1.9.0 and 1.8.3 expected soon

Several blocker bugs found in the 2 previous release candidates have
delayed the release of 1.9.0, which is expected to be out around August
17th. Read
the [announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foreman-users/7sZK9HrJvq4)
or the [release
notes](http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.9/index.html#Releasenotesfor1.9)
for more details.  
Foreman 1.8.3, a bug fix release, will also be released at approximately
the same time.  
We appreciate your help testing the release candidates and reporting
bugs!

### Katello 2.3 RC2 is ready for testing
