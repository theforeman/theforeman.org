**Update**

There is an updated version of this post available targetting version
1.10. It can be found [here](http://theforeman.org/2016/02/ec2-provisioning-using-foreman-update.html)


One of foreman goals, is to provide a simple and familiar process to
provision systems, regardless of where they are located.

We've now added the ability to provision systems in EC2, alongside with
the existing virtualization providers such as RHEVM, libvirt, VMWare
etc.

In this blog, I'll try to describe step by step what is required in
order to provision a new instance in EC2.

<!--more-->

### Requirements

-   You should be using a recent version of foreman, either directly
    from
    [git](http://theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Installing_latest_code),
    or using the nightly, see for git instruction, or use the
    [debian](http://theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/Installing_latest_code),[redhat
    or fedora](http://people.redhat.com/jmontleo/foreman/)
    nightly packages.
-   Have a working foreman server, this should include operating
    system definitions and unattended mode enabled In addition
    storeconfigs data must not be stored in the foreman database.
-   Amazon valid EC2 access and secret keys.
-   Security Group which allows foreman to SSH to the instance.

### Configuring AWS

Click on the **more** tab, and select **Compute Resources**.
**Compute Resources** are services that can generate a host, e.g.
VMWare, libvirt, openstack etc.

Click on **New Compute Resource** and fill in the information about your
new compute resource, normally the name should represent something
meaningful to you, such as a combination of the ec2 region and the
account used.

if everything is entered correctly, you should be able to get back a
list of regions and select the region that you would like to deploy
to.

Foreman would then automatically create a new set of SSH keypairs, which
would be used in order to configure the instance (you may remove them
later on).

Then, the next step is to define which images are allowed to use and
assign them to Foreman Operation systems / architectures.

Click on the **image** tab and select **New Image**.

Since foreman would SSH to the instance (at least for now, we've decided
using ssh first, cloud-init later), it is very important that you define
the correct user, that is configured on the ami (normally the ubuntu
user, or ec2-user) and of course, the ami id.

Foreman is now ready to create your instance, however, in order to
automate fully puppet to load upon instance launch, we would need to
create a little post script, this is where the provisioning templates
comes into play.

### Configuring Provisioning Templates

Add or edit a new provisioning template, **More =&gt;** **Provisioning
Templates =&gt; New **

![Edit Image](/static/images/blog_images/2012-05-31-ec2-provisioning-using-foreman/finish.png)

Select **Finish** and paste the following content in

{% gist ohadlevy/2841883 %}

Don't forget to associate the template, (in the association tab) and set
a default per OS (in the OS settings)

Then add the snippets too

#### etc-hosts

{% gist ohadlevy/2841937 %}

#### puppet.conf

{% gist ohadlevy/2841950 %}

An important note about **UUID's for certnames**: if you want to use this
feature, please make sure that you enable *use\_uuid\_for\_certificates* under
**More =&gt; Settings**, if not, you can simply use &lt;%= @host.name %&gt; for
the certname. Additionally, it is not compatible with storeconfigs at this time.

And if you want to provision a whole puppet master in EC2, you can use
the following snippet to get it up and running

#### master\_bootstrap

{% gist ohadlevy/2841952 %}

Now if you ask your self how variables like **ntp-server** get resolved,
they are simply Foreman smart vars

### Actual instance launch

Goto to the **Hosts** tab, click on **New Host**, among other settings,
make sure you select your compute resource,  image and hardware profile

#### Primary tab

#### Operating System tab

#### Virtual Machine tab

#### Progress bar

As always, since this is a new feature, any feedback, comments etc are
welcomed!
