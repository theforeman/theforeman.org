Community regulars will know that we do a community survey every year, and 2019
is no exception. This is our yearly attempt to understand more about the fine
folks that use our project, how changes we've made are being received, and work
out what's important to tackle next.

Obviously we'd like as many responses as possible (it's usually ~180, maybe we
can do better this year :P), so *please* do try to find 10 mins to fill it in.
Every question is optional, so if something doesn't apply to you skip it, or if
you get bored skip to the end and submit what you got done - even partial
replies are useful!

Again, this is a great opportunity to get your views across to us - Foreman
doesn't contain any form of tracking, so we literally have no other way to
gather a lot of this data. Help us out!
