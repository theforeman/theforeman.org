  The Foreman Community wants to hear from YOU at our upcoming conferences.
  Read on for details!
---

In just over 2 months, the yearly chaos of the Foreman convention season will
be upon us. FOSDEM! CfgMgmtCamp! DevConf! Busy, busy, busy, and we want you to
be a part of it! **Come tell us your story**.

For these events to be successful, we need lots of good Foreman talks - and we
want to hear your Foreman story. These conferences aren't just for developers
to show off the latest cool feature (although that's always nice), but rather
serve as an opportunity for the community to meet in-person with names normally
only seen in IRC, share it's knowledge, swap stories, and learn from each
other. To do that, we need a mix of talks, from success stories, lessons from the front line, plugins used to solve a problem
and so on, in *addition* to the those dev previews.

The Call For Presentations (CFPs) for all 3 conferences are currently open, but
they close in **just a few days**! If you're interesting in telling your story,
please do submit talks to any (or all!) of the conferences you'll be at.

If you'd *like* to speak, but are concerned about any aspect of it, or aren't
sure if your idea is suitable then get in touch with [me][mail_greg] and I'll
be happy to help you out.
