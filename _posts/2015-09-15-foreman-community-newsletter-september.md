### Foreman 1.9 and 1.9.1 released

Foreman 1.9.0 was published on August 18th followed by a bugfix 1.9.1
release on September 11th.  

New features in this version include:  
-   A few small web UI enahncements such as new search-enabled dropdown
    menus throughout the application and full screen editor for
    parameters
-   Template editing forms have now capability to preview edits on the
    rendered template.
-   Foreman's logging has become more granular so it's now easier to
    enable debugging of specific subsystems.
-   Two new email notifications for listing recent audit activities and
    for notifying when a host has built.
-   Libvirt has gained a new capability for using cloud-init when
    image provisioning.

  
The full list of the changes is available in release notes for both
Foreman 1.9 and Foreman 1.9.1:

### Foreman 1.8 bugfix release

Foreman 1.8.3 has been released on August 19th with half a dozen bug
fixes.Â  All components have been updated.  
  
Full release notes are on the website here:  
<http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.8/index.html#Releasenotesfor1.8.3>

1.9.0, unless there is a severe security issue or a significant number
of regressions get fixed.
