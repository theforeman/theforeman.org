### Config Management Camp 2019 - Call for Presentations (closes 1st Dec)

The CFP for Config Management Camp closes very soon! We'll be there (as
always), and we'd love to hear your stories about Foreman - use cases,
tips/tricks, best practises, plugins, the list goes on, and all of it is
welcome. We're especially interested in user-oriented talks, as development
talks are easily covered by the core team - we think it would be great to have
more discussions around promoting and encouraging working practice with
Foreman.

So, please, *don't* think you have nothing to add to this discussion -
you do! Get your submissions in by Monday :)

We'll also have a stand at FOSDEM, and a Hackday after CfgMgmtCamp, so book
your travel for 2nd-6th of Feb and join us for the whole ride!

### New Releases (1.20 and Katello 3.9)

The latest and greatest Foreman is now out (version 1.20), and as always a
*huge* thanks to the team and the community for the work that goes into
building, packaging, and testing these releases. Foreman 1.20 brings many new
goodies, including UI improvements, a new templating engine, an entirely *new*
system for templating reports, FIPS compliance and more!

You can find all the juicy details in the [release announcement][1_20_0], and
as always, if you do find issues then please [report them!][issues]

With a new version of Foreman comes a new version of Katello, and this release
is no exception. Katello 3.9 is now available, bringing content view export and
import, system purpose, and modularity integration, as well as well over 100
fixed bugs. Check out the [release announcement][k_3_9] for more details, and
do report any [issues][k_issues].

As I already said, many thanks to the contributors to these releases - coders,
RC testers, documentation writers, and bug/feature reporters. Foreman wouldn't
be what it is without you!

### UI interaction study needs your help

Tereza from our UI team would like to study how people use the newly redesigned
Audits page in Foreman 1.20. If you've upgraded, and can spare 20 mins, please
check out
[this thread](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-1-20-0-and-audits-redesign-user-testing/11861)
for details on how you can be involved. Thanks!

### [Upcoming Events](https://community.theforeman.org/c/events/l/calendar)

It's pretty quiet this month, with all the holidays, travel, etc, that happens around December...

All Foreman events are available via [the forum
calendar](https://community.theforeman.org/calendar) - hit the Subscribe button
(which will give you an ICS link). You can also use the Add To Calendar button
on specific events if you don't wish to import the whole thing.

Future community demos will now be created much further in advance, so you
should be able to keep up with upcoming demos there.

* [Community Demo #54](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-54)

All the usual goodness from the community, rounded up and presented for your viewing pleasure.

* [FOSDEM 2019, 2-3rd Feb](https://community.theforeman.org/t/fosdem-2019/11964)

Our usual yearly meetup, we'll be there with a stand, and plenty of folk to
talk about Foreman's latest & greatest. Stop by and say hi!

* [CfgMgmtCamp 2019, 4-6th](https://community.theforeman.org/t/config-management-camp/11966)

Foreman will be at CfgMgmtCamp 2019, with booth, talks, demos, swag, and
probably dinner out on Tuesday night. Join us for our flagship event!

On Wed 6th we'll also run our usual CfgMgmtCamp edition Hackday, so if
contributing is your thing (even if you're new to it) then stay for this - past
years have had around 20 attendees and been *very* productive.

#### [Past Events](https://community.theforeman.org/c/events/l/latest)
