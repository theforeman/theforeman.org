Last week I had the pleasure of presenting Foreman 1.0 at redhat offices
in Brno, CZ.  
  
It was done during our lunch and learn sessions (people like it becuase
you get free pizza or so)  which could explain a few of the interesting
background noises during the talk.  
  
as usually, demos don't work out as planned, but I decided to leave it
all, so you can enjoy for yourself.  
  
this by no means its a complete demo of 1.0 features, but maybe a more
general overview and its features in 1.0.  
  
many thanks to inecas and lzap for taking care for the details and
capturing the talk on video.
