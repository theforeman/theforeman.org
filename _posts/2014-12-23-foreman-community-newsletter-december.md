### Foreman 1.7.0 and 1.7.1 released

A new version of the Foreman went out in early December, followed by a
bugfix release.  
Headline features of the releases are:  
-   enhancements to smart class parameters, providing better control
    over default values and merging of values across matchers
-   a new build review page that should help you check for common errors
    when switching a host into build mode
-   support for specifying bonds, VLANs and aliased interfaces on a
    host-importing interfaces them from facts
-   two existing features have been moved into plugins
    ([foreman\_host\_rundeck](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_host_rundeck),
    [smart\_proxy\_chef](https://github.com/theforeman/smart_proxy_chef))
    and have their separate lifecycle now

Detailed information about the changes in the releases is available in
our [Foreman
1.7.0](http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.7/index.html#Releasenotesfor1.7.0)
and [Foreman
1.7.1](http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.7/index.html#Releasenotesfor1.7.0)
release notes.

  

This release also marks the end of Debian 6 (Squeeze) support, and Ruby
1.8.7 in the Foreman application (not the proxy or installer).Â 

  

Thanks to all [our
contributors](http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.7/index.html#Contributors)!

After a long period of silence new versions of Hammer CLI and Hammer CLI
Foreman were released. They bring new commands for managing external
user groups and LDAP auth sources, YAML and JSON exports and enable for

### Features in development

**Networking**

Bunch of networking improvements is [approaching
merge](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/pull/1988). This change
brings more flexibility into specifying primary and provisioning
interfaces. The UI has been simplified and split up into a NICs overview
table and modal windows showing details.  
  

**Multihost deployment**

Work on multihost deployment continue. December was in the name of
defining a data model. The current state is thoroughly described in [a
deepdive on this topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFPLGfA6-jU).  
  

**Moving to Rails 4**

We've started with first steps towards moving to Rails 4 this month.
Stay tuned for more information.
