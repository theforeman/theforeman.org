\#theforeman in Freenode to ask questions.  

### Featured media 

Mitchell Anicas wrote a great tutorial on how to setup Foreman 1.5 to
manage an installation of Ubuntu 14.04 nodes. It is part of a series on
Puppet and Configuration management. [Check it out in the DigitalOcean
community
site.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-foreman-to-manage-puppet-nodes-on-ubuntu-14-04)  
  
We also discovered recently an article by Anthony Lapenna on Foreman and
Puppet infrastructure setup, the scalable way. [Check it out if you want
ideas for a solid Foreman and Puppet
infrastructure.](http://deviantony.wordpress.com/2014/06/21/setup-a-scalable-puppet-environment-with-foreman-on-ubuntu-12-04/)  
  
[Sprint 29 demo was recently
published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-gsgp1IDfA), if you want to
follow the latest from the Foreman development team. It covers EFI and
QEMU setup in Foreman, bond and fencing network devices support,
foreman\_host\_rundeck, foreman\_graphite, hammer-cli-foreman-ssh,
changes in the code base to use gem friendly\_id and [puppet server
support.](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-server)
