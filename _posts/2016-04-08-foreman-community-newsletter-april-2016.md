### New media and blogs
[Community demo](https://youtu.be/P6gX5OHXgbw) on 31th March 2016
 With most of our developers were busy fixing bugs for the new releases, there wasn't much to demo - instead we sat down with Daniel Lobato Garcia and Eric Helms for an informal meet-the-devs chat!
Let us know if you'd like to see more of this style of content!

We continued our [user case study](https://youtu.be/DMWDJuFgyEU) series, and this time with Alex Balk from Outbrain talking about Discovery & Chef. Thanks Alex!
