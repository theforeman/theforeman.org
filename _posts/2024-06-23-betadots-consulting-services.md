[betadots GmbH](https://www.betadots.de/) joins the group of companies that
provide professional services for Foreman!

<!--more-->

Well, not really right now. We already do this since years! betadots is a
German consulting company with a focus on automation with open source
tooling. We have a long history in the Puppet ecosystem. We assist companies
with their planning and upgrading of their Puppet and Foreman infrastructure.
Besides that we also offer public and inhouse trainings for Puppet and
Foreman/Katello (with or without Puppet). The training material is also public
at: [github.com/betadots/foreman-training](https://github.com/betadots/foreman-training?tab=readme-ov-file#foremankatello-training).

betadots maintains an open source tool to visualize Hiera data,
[HDM (Hiera Data Manager)](https://github.com/betadots/hdm?tab=readme-ov-file#hdm---hiera-data-manager).
We also maintain a foreman plugin to display the information within the Foreman
UI.

Foreman has multiple Puppet modules to bootstrap Foreman and Katello, we provide
regular patches to the modules to improve the code quality, update dependencies
or implement new features.
