If, like me, you've been waiting for Deb support in [Katello][katello], then
there's reason to celebrate. Matthias Dellweg and his colleagues at
[AtixAG][atix] have just published a blog post detailing where they're up to
with the Deb support - in short, it works! The necessary pieces have been
merged into Pulp, and now the work begins on the [Katello PR][pr] to get the
needed patches into Katello, and then it'll be available for all!

Head on over to the [AtixAG blog and read the details][post]!
