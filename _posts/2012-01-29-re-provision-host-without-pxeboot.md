So, yet another feature not many people know about Foreman.

it is really easy to reprovision (reinstall, or even to a whole new os)
an existing system without PXE.

<!--more-->

Foreman supports the following provisioning templates:

-   provision - kickstart, preseed, jumpstart, yast..
-   PXELinux - templates for syslinux / pxelinux
-   gPXE - templates for {g,i}PXE
-   finish - for OS's that requies a second stage script
    (debian, solaris)
-   PXEGrub - templates for GRUB PXE
-   script - custom entry for what ever you might want to do with
    foreman templates

All of these templates are available usually at:
foreman/unattended/&lt;name&gt;



the default script template that comes with foreman does the following :



gets the kernel/initrd and reconfigure grub, so upon next reboot, you
can provision your host.



for example, put your host in build mode, and on your host simply
execute

once ready simply:

    curl http://foreman/unattended/script | sh
    reboot


This generates something like
