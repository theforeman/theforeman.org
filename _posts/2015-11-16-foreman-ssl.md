  In this guest post by Dan Foster, learn more about how to replace the
  auto-generated SSL that comes with Foreman with a signed and trusted SSL cert
  from your CA.
---

[Foreman](http://theforeman.org/) does a great job of providing SSL support out-of-the-box, it does this by using the SSL certificates generated by your puppet-ca. Unless your users web browsers all trust the puppet CA (unlikely), any human user of Foreman is going to get SSL warnings. Replacing Foremans SSL certifcate with one that's signed by a default trusted CA requires some care for 2 reasons:

 * Other components apart from humans using web browers, need to validate the Foreman server. Therefore we need to make sure these components validate the Forman server against the correct CA.
 * Foreman uses SSL client authentication to authenticate various components via their puppet-ca certificates. We need to make sure we do *not* change the CA that foreman uses to authenticate these components.

The following diagram shows the various components talking to the Forman server and which communications require the SSL keys changing.

For the following examples, the new certificates live in the following locations:

 * SSL Certificate: `/etc/pki/tls/certs/puppet.example.com.crt`
 * SSL Private Key: `/etc/pki/tls/private/puppet.example.com.key`
 * SSL CA Chain:    `/etc/pki/tls/certs/cachain.crt`

Foreman
=======

Foreman is presented via mod_passenger on Apache, so the SSL keys need to be changed in your apache VirtualHost. For me this was `/etc//httpd/conf.d/05-foreman-ssl.conf`.

The following options need to be changed: `SSLCertificateFile`, `SSLCertificateKeyFile` and `SSLCertificateChainFile`.
It is important that you do **not** change `SSLCACertificateFile` or `SSLCARevocationFile`, as these are used for client authentication. Your final config should look like this:

```
  ## SSL directives
SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile      "/etc/pki/tls/certs/puppet.example.com.crt"
SSLCertificateKeyFile   "/etc/pki/tls/private/puppet.example.com.key"
SSLCertificateChainFile "/etc/pki/tls/certs/cachain.crt"
SSLCACertificatePath    "/etc/pki/tls/certs"
SSLCACertificateFile    "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem"
SSLCARevocationFile     "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/ca_crl.pem"
SSLVerifyClient         optional
SSLVerifyDepth          3
SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
```

If you use the Console feature for foreman, you will also want to change the `websockets_ssl_key` and `websockets_ssl_cert` keys in `/etc/foreman/settings.yaml`. For example:

```
:websockets_ssl_key:  /etc/pki/tls/private/puppet.example.com.key
:websockets_ssl_cert: /etc/pki/tls/certs/puppet.example.com.crt
```

Smart Proxy
===========

If you have your smart proxies running on the same box as foreman, make sure
`foreman_ssl_ca` is **not** defined in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yaml` and
it will read the CA from the main foreman settings.

Puppet
======

Change `ssl_ca` in `/etc/puppet/foreman.yaml`, do not change `ssl_cert` or `ssl_key`. For example:

```
:ssl_ca: "/etc/pki/tls/certs/cachain.crt"
:ssl_cert: "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/puppet.example.com.pem"
:ssl_key: "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/private_keys/puppet.example.com.pem"
```

Managing with puppet
====================

If you use manage your foreman and puppet install with the `theforeman/puppet`
and `theforeman/foreman` modules, you can configure all the above with the
following hiera data:

```
foreman::ssl: true
puppet::server_foreman_ssl_ca: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/cachain.crt'
puppet::server_foreman_url: 'https://puppet.example.com'
foreman::server_ssl_key: '/etc/pki/tls/private/puppet.example.com.key'
foreman::server_ssl_cert: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/puppet.example.com.crt'
foreman::server_ssl_chain: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/cachain.crt'
foreman::servername: 'puppet.example.com'
foreman::foreman_url: 'https://puppet.example.com'
foreman::websockets_ssl_key: '/etc/pki/tls/private/puppet.example.key'
foreman::websockets_ssl_cert: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/puppet.example.crt'
```
