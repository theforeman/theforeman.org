## Foreman's 7th Birthday

**It's our birthday!** On July 13th, we'll be 7 years old. In combination with
the 1.12 release, including the long-awaited Puppet 4 support, we think this
worth celebrating!

## Time for a party!

We're planning a series of regional events though out the second half of July
and early August. Below you'll find details of what's currently planned - do
check back for updates. All the events will of course be available on the
[events page](/events) and the [ICS calendar](/events/all.ics).

If you want to organise a Foreman event yourself, please do! We'll be happy to
support you, just drop a line to the [community
guy](mailto:community@emeraldreverie.org).

### Foreman @ Techmeetup Edinburgh (13th July 2016)

The birthday party kicks off in Edinburgh, where our very own community guy,
[Greg Sutcliffe](https://twitter.com/gwmngilfen) will be giving a Foreman talk
to the [Techmeetup](http://techmeetup.co.uk) community. This is likely to be an
overview talk, covering the basics of Foreman, what's new in 1.12, and it's
awesome community.

This talk should be recorded and livestreamed (links will be added here once we
know them) so do tune in and get involved.

### Foreman @ NETWAYS Nürnberg (21st July 2016)

One evening of Foreman not enough? How about a proper half-day event with
hands-on time and multiple speakers? Now, that's a party!

The awesome folks at NETWAYS are hosting a halfday Foreman event, kicking off
with 2+ hours of hands-on time with Foreman - perfect for your first steps with
Foreman, to get help from some of the experienced people present, or just to do
some in-person hacking.

We'll then break for coffee before having some talks from users and
contributors, and then head out for some food.
