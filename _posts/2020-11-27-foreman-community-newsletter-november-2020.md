Thanks to everyone who asked and answered questions, opened issues, and made the Foreman Community a hive of activity over the last month. Here is a summary of some of the major events, contributions, and requests for feedback over the last month.

## Foreman 2.3 RC2 is available for testing!

Please evaluate this release candidate to help make the next Foreman release as stable as possible.

## Roadmapping Foreman and Katello through Redmine Tickets

This month, [@ezr-ondrej](https://community.theforeman.org/u/ezr-ondrej) expressed his long-lasting wish to have a roadmap communicating features that we plan to deliver in upcoming releases. He outlines where we fell down with past efforts on this, and proposes a solution. Please read [@ezr-ondrej](https://community.theforeman.org/u/ezr-ondrej)'s [post](https://community.theforeman.org/t/roadmapping-foreman-and-katello-through-redmine-trackers/21380?u=mcorr) and share your thoughts with him on his proposal.

### ForemanCon Survey

Although we've been running online events, such as deep dives and the community demo, for a number of years, this entirely online format is still new to us. From what we can see, our presence at European conferences will be moved online in early 2021 also. We want to know what you think after a number of such online events. Is it working? Would you like longer or shorter events? How can we make the most of your time? If you have any feedback, please provide it in the [ForemanCon Survey](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foremancon-survey/21249?u=mcorr).

## Boltello Updates

Last month, community member [@gerard.ryan](https://community.theforeman.org/u/gerard.ryan) posted about his [Boltello project](https://community.theforeman.org/t/boltello-requesting-feedback/20782?u=mcorr), which uses Puppet Bolt to create a completely Hiera-driven, enterprise-like installation of open source Puppet, with all the preconfigurations of, for example, the Foreman web UI and ENC, Katello packaging management, Hiera, r10k and Foreman REX integration. This month he returned with the news that [Remote databases capability has been added.](https://community.theforeman.org/t/boltello-requesting-feedback/20782/19?u=mcorr). [@gerard.ryan](https://community.theforeman.org/u/gerard.ryan) has an open call for feedback, so please feel free to provide any feedback that you have!
