In this post, we'll see how to install [oVirt](http://ovirt.org/). for
those of you who ask oVirt?! well, taken from its website:

> THE VIRTUAL DATACENTER MANAGEMENT PLATFORM Provision, manage, and
> monitor hosts, hypervisors, virtual machines, storage, and network

So really, oVirt is a management eco system for virtual machines, fairly
similar to v-sphere, but open source and runs on the very popular KVM
hypervisor, oVirt is the open source version, of the
redhat's [RHEV-M](http://www.redhat.com/products/virtualization/).

My motivation for this series of posts, beside promoting alternative and
cool open source software is the integration between oVirt and Foreman,
so provisioning of vm's would get a whole new meaning when you have a
virtual data center managed by oVirt where you could plug in puppet into
the loop.

I've tested the oVirt management (oVirts core/backend) on Fedora 16,
mostly because RPM's for RHEL clones has not made by the community just
yet :)

It is recommended to use something with a minimum of 2GB of RAM, 4GB
better, as oVirt runs under jboss, however, it is not a problem to run
oVirt on a virtual machine.

So enough about that, its awesome and open source, how do I install it?

In a follow up post I'll describe how to configure oVirt, and how to
starts creates new VM's.
