A lot has happened this month.
A big thank you to everyone who made September a busy time in the Foreman community!

## Foreman 3.0 has landed!

This release is a culmination of years of work on many fronts. Firstly, this release sees the extraction of Puppet functionality from Foreman core. Also, a draft of the new host details page has landed.

Here are some links to important information about this release:

* [Foreman 3.0 release announcement](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-3-0-0-has-been-released/25285)
* The Foreman 3.0 blog with [details of how to enable the new host details page and more](https://theforeman.org/2021/09/foreman-30-is-here.html)
* [Puppet in Foreman 3.0 information](https://community.theforeman.org/t/puppet-in-3-0-release/24429)
* [Foreman 3.0 host detail page discussion](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-3-0-new-host-detail-page-feedback/25281)

The future of the host details page is very much in your hands. Please tell us what you think.

The Foreman 3.0 release attracted a bit of attention, and we found ourselves at #4 on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28569690) one Friday night.

[devclass.com](devclass.com) also has a nice [feature report](https://devclass.com/2021/09/21/foreman-3/) of the changes in Foreman 3.0.

Last but not least, [@Dirk](https://community.theforeman.org/u/dirk/summary) has a lovely German-language article [Foreman 3.0 â€“ Was bedeutet der neue Major-Release](https://www.netways.de/blog/2021/09/23/foreman-3-0-major-release/) about the release.

If you spot anything else about Foreman online, please [let us know](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-3-0-in-the-news/25466).


## Katello 4.2 RC 3 is ready for testing

## New Foreman & Salt Configuration docs

Thanks to [@maximilian](https://community.theforeman.org/u/maximilian/summary) and the folks at [ATIX](atix.de), our [Managing Hosts guide](https://docs.theforeman.org/nightly/Managing_Hosts/index-foreman-el.html#using-salt-for-configuration-management_managing-hosts) has an entire chapter on setting up and using Salt for host configuration management in Foreman.

If you use the docs, [let us know what you think](https://community.theforeman.org/t/new-salt-configuration-management-documenation-is-available/25263/3)

## Simplifying Foreman's taxonomy model

[@ezr-ondrej](https://community.theforeman.org/u/ezr-ondrej) has posted his thoughts on one of the historical and ongoing challenges for Foreman: the taxonomy model is very hard to understand for both users and developers. Read [@ezr-ondrej's](https://community.theforeman.org/t/single-organization-on-resources-to-simplify-taxonomies/25416) and consider how this has impacted you as a user or developer, and join the discussion.


## New Tutorials Contributed This Month

Foreman is as strong as the community that contributes to it. There are many different ways to contribute. If you have a workflow that is novel, divergent, or undocumented, it might help other other community members extend their own Foreman deployments, please [post a tutorial](https://community.theforeman.org/c/tutorials/23).

Here are some tutorials contributed this month.

### Foreman 3.0 with LetsEncrypt

[@Neeloj](https://community.theforeman.org/u/neeloj/) contributed [a tutorial](https://community.theforeman.org/t/how-to-use-foreman-with-letsencrypt/25323) that provides the setup for using LetsEncrypt with Foreman 3.0.

### Foreman Application Server Puma Status Monitoring

[@Marek_Hulan](https://community.theforeman.org/u/Marek_Hulan) added a tutorial that provides information about how [to monitor and control the Puma service in Foreman](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-application-server-puma-status-monitoring/23154).


### Adding Raspberry Pi 10 (Buster) Devices to Foreman

[@gawainxl](https://community.theforeman.org/u/gawainxl/summary) provided a tutorial on adding [Raspberry Pi 10 (Debian Buster) devices to Foreman](https://community.theforeman.org/t/adding-raspberry-pi-10-buster-devices-to-foreman/25450).


## Automating Systems with Foreman, AWX, and FreeIPA

A few months back, [@parmstrong](https://community.theforeman.org/u/parmstr) wrote about a Foreman use case that is not very well known in the community. Paul's blog describes using custom facts to [automate the discovery of an Intel NUC machines cluster with Foreman](https://theforeman.org/2021/05/implementing-custom-facts-for-foreman-discovery.html). In his latest article, Paul guides you through provisioning and configuring hosts so that you can deliver complete solutions in a repeatable manner. Read [Automating systems with Foreman, AWX, and FreeIPA](https://theforeman.org/2021/09/automating-systems-with-foreman-awx-and-freeipa.html) on our blog!

## Centos 8 will EOL in December

Foreman is the ideal tool to manage and take full control of your Centos Stream servers. You can read more in a recent opensource.com article [Manage CentOS Stream with Foreman](https://opensource.com/article/21/9/centos-stream-foreman).
