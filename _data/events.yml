    with Foreman.
    We will also go though some features that can be added to Foreman through
    plugins; remote execution as orthogonal tool to the standard config
    management tools and discovery for metal as as service capabilities.

    you're interested in UX improvement in Foreman, the JavaScript / client
    side future of Foreman, or just want to understand what React is, this is
    for you. As ever, questions and feedback will be welcome during the show,

    two ways to achieve the goal: Foreman Remote Execution that allows high

    hosts and Ansible integration, that leverages the Ansible for similar purposes.

    UI technologies. Redux is an opinionated state container library, that is
    built on the foundations of functional programming. It allows our UI to be
    predictable, maintainable and highly testable. If you are interested in
    making your code more readable and maintainable, and to have an
    opinionated, well defined, data flow, join us! This talk requires no
    previous knowledge of redux, react, or anything except basic JS chops
    (ES6). We will go over the motivation, and the concepts behind flux, and
    later dive in to real-world implementation using redux in our foreman app!

    Foreman already manages most of the lifecycle of your servers. To really
    put a server into production, it's considered good practice to use
    automated monitoring to alert you whenever something doesn't behave like it
    should. The new Foreman and SmartProxy monitoring plugin's allow an
    administrator to connect Foreman and the monitoring solution Icinga 2.  In
    the deep dive, we want to show basic functionality of the plugins and
    explain how to set this up in your environment.

    After we went over through most pages of Foreman and its plugins, we would
    like to concentrate on more complex changes that requires a design or a
    discussion involving all interested parties. We'd like to incrementally
    discuss progress from both current design and implementation perspective as
    well as generic usability questions that pop up.  This time we'll focus on
    various provisioning flows, look at first draft and discuss further steps.
    Demos will be recorded and streamed live so anyone from community can
    participate.

    For the next in our series of UX reviews, we're looking at Katello's
    content hosts. With the upcoming work on the unification of hosts and
    content hosts it will be important to consider the UI/UX of both and how
    that combines into a unified host experience. This week we will look at as
    much of the content host pages as we have time for (this may end up being a
    two part series) in order to inform decisions about host unification in the
    future.

    Recently, we proposed migrating one or both of our Google Groups mailing
    lists to a Discourse (self-hosted). You can read more about that on the
    mailing list. On this video, our community lead, Greg, will host an Ask Me
    Anything about Discourse - why we need it, what the feature set is, how to
    get started with it, and of course a full discussion of concerns. Join us
    live to put your questions to Greg!

    For the next in our series of UX reviews, we're looking at new breadcrumbs and item switcher.
    The change to vertical navigation made two-pane a little less comfortable because the
    space to edit became smaller. Additionally, some users reported confusion around navigation
    context as well as inconsistencies in regards to two-pane navigation.
    We'll focus on the addition of breadcrumbs that would improve navigation compared to two pane.
    We'd be glad to get feedback on this proposed change.
