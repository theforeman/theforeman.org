    with Foreman.
    We will also go though some features that can be added to Foreman through
    plugins; remote execution as orthogonal tool to the standard config
    management tools and discovery for metal as as service capabilities.

    provisioning. We'll also cover DHCP & DNS orchestration, virtualization
    support, and at the end, some notable Foreman plugins, such as Ansible,

    One of the latest features built into Foreman is an ability to get the job
    done through real-time actions on managed hosts. We will show and talk about
    two ways to achieve the goal: Foreman Remote Execution that allows high
    flexibility around the specific technology used for sending commands to the
    hosts and Ansible integration, that leverages the Ansible for similar purposes.

    In this Deep Dive Matan Werbner will be joining us for another session on
    UI technologies. Redux is an opinionated state container library, that is
    built on the foundations of functional programming. It allows our UI to be
    predictable, maintainable and highly testable. If you are interested in
    making your code more readable and maintainable, and to have an
    opinionated, well defined, data flow, join us! This talk requires no
    previous knowledge of redux, react, or anything except basic JS chops
    (ES6). We will go over the motivation, and the concepts behind flux, and
    later dive in to real-world implementation using redux in our foreman app!

    Foreman already manages most of the lifecycle of your servers. To really
    put a server into production, it's considered good practice to use
    automated monitoring to alert you whenever something doesn't behave like it
    should. The new Foreman and SmartProxy monitoring plugin's allow an
    administrator to connect Foreman and the monitoring solution Icinga 2.  In
    the deep dive, we want to show basic functionality of the plugins and
    explain how to set this up in your environment.
