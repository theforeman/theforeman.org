    like to share with you some recent changes and features that you might be
    interested in.
    First of all, long-awaited feature of Foreman is now here; Puppet 4 support
    was requested more than a year ago and now it should be fully compatible
    with Foreman.
    We will also go though some features that can be added to Foreman through
    plugins; remote execution as orthogonal tool to the standard config
    management tools and discovery for metal as as service capabilities.
