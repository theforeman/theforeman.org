# Support
------------------------------

## Community Guidelines

We have a variety of communication tools that the Foreman Community uses to get
work done. The guidelines below apply in general when interacting with other
Foreman users & developers:

* Be nice: Treat people with respect and consideration.
* Be helpful: Be patient with new people and be willing to jump in to answer questions.
* Be patient: People often have many other things to do, so allow time for your question to be answered
* Stay calm: When in doubt, assume the best intentions and do not let emotions get out of control
* Try to keep conversations on-topic where possible - going off on a tangent doesn't solve anyone's problem.
* Search first: Your question might not be new or you might be able to find someone who has already asked or answered your question. Do a thorough search of the [Manual](https://theforeman.org/), the [Redmine Issues](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/issues), and the [Forum](https://community.theforeman.org/) to see if it has been answered before.

There are also a few extra medium-specific guidelines, listed with each type of support below.

### Reporting Violations

Should you need to speak with someone about another Foreman member's behaviour,
email *Greg Sutcliffe* (greg at emeraldreverie.org, male) and/or *Ori Rabin*
(orabin at redhat.com, female).  We'll do our best to listen to your issue fairly
and take appropriate action.

## Gathering information

To get appropriate support, you need to provide sufficient information about
your operating system, environment and setup. You can utilize the
foreman-debug tool - for more info see the [manual](/manuals/latest/index.html#7.3GettingHelp).

## ![Redmine icon](static/images/redmine.png) [Issue tracker](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/issues)

The issue tracker (Redmine) should be used to check for existing issues or to file a new issue.  First, [find the project](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects) and then use the _Issues_ tab to view bugs and feature requests.  Use the search feature at the top of the issue list to filter by _Category_ to narrow down the results.

When filing a new issue, check that the correct project is selected, then click the _New Issue_ link in the header.  Try to set the _Category_, _Found in release_ and include as much information as possible, including log files and screenshots.  For support requests, please use one of the other options below.

## ![Discourse icon](static/images/discourse.png) [Discourse Forum](https://community.theforeman.org)

We use a Discourse forum for our community interactions. For help or support
with Foreman problems, questions and answers or general discussion, post to the
Support board:

* [Support](https://community.theforeman.org/c/support) or email `users@community.theforeman.org` (account required)

For discussions about developing Foreman or plugins, use the Development board:

* [Development](https://community.theforeman.org/c/development) or email `dev@community.theforeman.org` (account required)

There is also a low-traffic board dedicated to release and security announcements:

* [Release Announcements](https://community.theforeman.org/c/release-announcements) or subscribe via [RSS](https://community.theforeman.org/c/release-announcements.rss)

### Forum Guidelines

In addition to the [general guidelines](/support.html#CommunityGuidelines) above, we also have a few forum-specific guidelines:

* Don't hijack threads - start new threads for new questions
* Don't attach or paste in huge attachments - upload them to a website and include links in your post
* Use Markdown formatting, especially for logs - put \`\`\` on the lines around the logs to format them as code.
* Let us know if your question is answered - the solution can be marked using
  the thread tools. This lets others know that you no longer need help, and helps
  others to find solutions when searching the archives

## ![IRC icon](static/images/freenode.png) [IRC live chat](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/?#theforeman)
A great place to get real-time help with The Foreman is our IRC channel:

* [#theforeman](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/?#theforeman) on [irc.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/)

There are usually many helpful people there in addition to some of the Foreman
developers.  For discussions about the intricacies of developing Foreman or
plugins, use the development channel:

* [#theforeman-dev](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/?#theforeman-dev) on [irc.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/)

Please read and understand [this fantastic guide](http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc)
to getting help for open-source projects on IRC before diving in. All of the
points there apply to #theforeman, especially "Don't repeat yourself", "Don't
ask to ask", and "Stick around".  #theforeman in particular has concentrations
of people in Europe (CEST) and East-coast US (EST), so asking your question
when those time zones are in business hours is more likely to get a good
result.

Be aware that the IRC channel is not an official support channel, it's an ad-hoc
group of people (some of whom work on Foreman for a living) self-organizing
to help each other out. If you do not receive an answer to your question,
(especially if you have not followed the getting help on IRC best practices!),
that doesnâ€™t mean you are out of options; the software may [have a
bug](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/issues), the docs may be
lacking, or it's possible Foreman doesn't yet support your use case. It just
means you need to keep troubleshooting to find out which.

### IRC Guidelines

In addition to the [general guidelines](/support.html#CommunityGuidelines) above, we also have a few IRC-specific guidelines:

* Don't post chunks: Avoid posting big chunks of text - use a [pastebin](http://pastie.org/) or similar service to shorten it to a link. Likewise, try not to spam the channel with many messages, it breaks the flow of other conversations.
* Don't private message: Ask permission before you send someone a private message (PM). Not everyone likes them. Also, by keeping it in public, others with similar issues can see the solution you were given.
* Don't highlight specific people unless you are already discussing something with them. Highlighting a specific user with your opening question makes it far less likely others will respond.

More information: This [IRC primer](http://irchelp.org/irchelp/ircprimer.html) for new users and the [general IRC guidelines, from freenode](http://freenode.net/channel_guidelines.shtml), are also useful resources.

## ![Matrix icon](static/images/matrix.png) [Matrix.org live chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#theforeman:matrix.org)

For those wanting something a little less "basic" than IRC, or just would like a
persistent connection, you can also find us on [Matrix.org](https://matrix.org)
- an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication
over IP. Matrix has many
[clients](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) available,
including browser-based, desktop & mobile apps, and even plugins for venerable
clients like WeeChat. Our rooms are in the public directory, but for reference:

* https://riot.im/app/#/room/#theforeman:matrix.org
* https://riot.im/app/#/room/#theforeman-dev:matrix.org

The Matrix rooms are bridged to the IRC channels, so we're all in the same chat.
Pick which you prefer!

## ![YouTube icon](static/images/youtube.png) [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCo7AZ1oG6TbG0-dwjRqCmw)
Please subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCo7AZ1oG6TbG0-dwjRqCmw). We regularly upload deep dives on Foreman features, screencasts to learn how to use the different features and plugins of Foreman, discussions and much more.

Our [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/102496134326414788199) regularly hosts live hangouts on a variety of topics. Become a member of the community and you will be notified about these events, so you can ask questions to the presenters and join the conversation.
